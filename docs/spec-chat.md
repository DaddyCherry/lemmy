 Tips for getting started:

 1. Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
 2. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 3. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
 4. ✔ Run /terminal-setup to set up terminal integration

> Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this
  idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a
  detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Let’s do this iteratively and dig
   into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

  Here’s the idea:

  lemmy is an elegant API wrapper of common LLM SDKs from Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, etc.
   The goal of lemmy is it to make creating agentic workflows extremely simple. It should
   be inspired by ruby_llm, but in TypeScript.

⏺ Looking at your project directory, I can see this is a fresh start for the lemmy
  TypeScript project. Let me ask the first question to understand the foundation:

  What specific LLM providers do you want lemmy to support initially, and should we
  prioritize a particular subset for the MVP?

  (For example: Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT models, Google Gemini, local models via
  Ollama, etc.)

> Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT models, Google Gemini, local models via Ollama is a good
  initial set.

⏺ Perfect! That's a solid foundation with the major providers plus local model support.

  What should the core abstraction look like - do you envision a unified client interface
   where users can switch providers with minimal code changes, or separate
  provider-specific clients with a common interface pattern?

  (For example: lemmy.chat("Hello", { provider: "anthropic" }) vs const claude =
  lemmy.anthropic(); claude.chat("Hello"))

⏺ Based on the ruby_llm analysis, I can see it provides a clean abstraction layer with
  unified model selection, stateful conversations, tool calling for agents, and streaming
   support.

  Given ruby_llm's approach of a unified interface (RubyLLM.chat(model:
  'provider/model')) with provider-agnostic method calls, should lemmy follow the same
  pattern where users specify the provider/model as a string parameter, or would you
  prefer a more TypeScript-idiomatic approach with separate typed clients?

  (For example: lemmy.chat({ model: 'claude-3-sonnet' }) vs lemmy.anthropic().chat() with
   full TypeScript intellisense for each provider's specific models and options)

> how would i select a specific model from a provider with the second typescript
  idiomatic approach?

⏺ With the TypeScript-idiomatic approach, model selection would look like this:

  // Provider-specific clients with typed model selection
  const claude = lemmy.anthropic();
  claude.chat({ model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022' }); // Full TypeScript autocomplete

  const openai = lemmy.openai();
  openai.chat({ model: 'gpt-4o' }); // Only valid OpenAI models suggested

  const gemini = lemmy.google();
  gemini.chat({ model: 'gemini-1.5-pro' }); // Only valid Google models

  const ollama = lemmy.ollama();
  ollama.chat({ model: 'llama2' }); // Local models

  Which approach do you prefer: the ruby_llm style unified interface (lemmy.chat({ model:
   'anthropic/claude-3-sonnet' })) where all providers share the same methods, or the
  TypeScript-typed approach above where each provider has its own client with full type
  safety for that provider's specific models and options?

> i think i prefer the second approach, so i can do provider specific stuff should the
  need arise, but would in general want a generic interface that works across all
  providers and models

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants the second approach (provider-specific clients) but with a generic
  interface that works across all providers. This means they want:

  1. Provider-specific clients like lemmy.anthropic(), lemmy.openai(), etc.
  2. But these clients should implement a common interface so they can be used
  generically
  3. This allows for provider-specific functionality when needed, but also allows for
  generic usage

  This is a great design pattern - they can have the best of both worlds. I should ask
  about how they want to handle the generic interface - whether it should be through a
  common base class/interface that all providers implement, or through some other
  abstraction mechanism.

⏺ Perfect! So you want provider-specific clients that implement a common interface. This
  gives you both type safety and flexibility.

  How would you like to handle the generic interface - should all provider clients
  implement a common interface (like ILLMClient) so you can write provider-agnostic code,
   or would you prefer a different abstraction pattern?

  For example:
  // Generic usage
  function askQuestion(client: ILLMClient, question: string) {
    return client.chat({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: question }] });
  }

  // Works with any provider
  const claude = lemmy.anthropic();
  const gpt = lemmy.openai();
  askQuestion(claude, "Hello");
  askQuestion(gpt, "Hello");

  // But still allows provider-specific features
  claude.useComputerUse(); // Anthropic-specific
  gpt.useStructuredOutputs(); // OpenAI-specific

> a common interface is good, though interfaces should never be prefixed with 'I'

⏺ Good point on the naming!

  What should the common interface be called, and should it be a TypeScript interface or
  an abstract base class?

  For example:
  // Interface approach
  interface LLMClient {
    chat(options: ChatOptions): Promise<ChatResponse>;
    stream(options: ChatOptions): AsyncIterable<ChatChunk>;
  }

  // Or abstract class approach
  abstract class LLMClient {
    abstract chat(options: ChatOptions): Promise<ChatResponse>;
    abstract stream(options: ChatOptions): AsyncIterable<ChatChunk>;
  }

  (Names like LLMClient, ChatClient, ModelClient, or something else?)

> I suppose ChatClient would make sense. In the future we could add EmbeddingClient or
  ImageGenClient etc. Note that we'll only do ChatClient for now though.

⏺ Great naming convention! That leaves room for future expansion.

  For the chat interface, what should the core method signatures look like? Specifically,
   should we follow a messages array pattern like OpenAI (with role/content objects), or
  a simpler string-based approach for basic usage with an option to use the full message
  format when needed?

  For example:
  interface ChatClient {
    // Simple string approach
    chat(prompt: string, options?: ChatOptions): Promise<ChatResponse>;

    // Or messages array approach
    chat(options: { messages: Message[], model?: string, ... }): Promise<ChatResponse>;

    // Or both?
    chat(prompt: string | { messages: Message[], ... }, options?: ChatOptions):
  Promise<ChatResponse>;
  }

> what do you think makes the most sense?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking for my opinion on the best approach for the chat interface. Let me
  think through the pros and cons:

  1. Simple string approach:
    - Pros: Very easy for basic use cases, minimal boilerplate
    - Cons: Limiting for complex conversations, system messages, etc.
  2. Messages array approach:
    - Pros: Consistent with industry standards (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), supports full
  conversation context, system messages, etc.
    - Cons: More verbose for simple cases
  3. Both (overloaded):
    - Pros: Best of both worlds - simple for basic cases, full power when needed
    - Cons: More complex API surface, potential confusion

  Looking at ruby_llm, they use a stateful conversation approach where you call
  .ask(string) on a conversation object, which is quite elegant. But they also support
  the full message array pattern.

  For TypeScript and modern LLM usage, I think the messages array approach makes the most
   sense because:
  1. It's the standard across all major LLM APIs
  2. It naturally supports conversation context
  3. It supports system messages, which are crucial for many use cases
  4. It's more explicit and predictable
  5. It's easier to make type-safe

  We could potentially add convenience methods later for simple string prompts.

⏺ I think the messages array approach makes the most sense as the primary interface
  because:

  1. Industry standard - All major LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) use this pattern
  2. Conversation support - Natural way to handle multi-turn conversations and system
  messages
  3. Type safety - Easier to make fully type-safe in TypeScript
  4. Explicit - Clear what's being sent to the model

  interface ChatClient {
    chat(options: {
      messages: Message[],
      model?: string,
      temperature?: number,
      // ... other options
    }): Promise<ChatResponse>;

    stream(options: { messages: Message[], ... }): AsyncIterable<ChatChunk>;
  }

  We could add convenience methods later like quickChat(prompt: string) that internally
  converts to the messages format.

  Should the Message type follow the OpenAI standard with role and content fields, or
  would you prefer a different structure?

> what does ruby_llm do?

⏺ From the ruby_llm docs I analyzed earlier, it uses both approaches:

  1. Simple string approach for basic usage:
  chat = RubyLLM.chat(model: 'gpt-4')
  response = chat.ask("What's the weather like?")

  2. Conversation context is maintained automatically - each .ask() call adds to the
  conversation history internally using a messages-like structure.
  3. System instructions are handled separately:
  chat.with_instructions("You are a helpful assistant")

  So ruby_llm abstracts away the messages array complexity for simple use cases, but
  maintains full conversation context under the hood.

  Should lemmy follow this pattern with a simple string-based API that automatically
  manages conversation history, or stick with the explicit messages array approach for
  more control and transparency?

> i like the ruby approach of internal management. i suppose we want a base class in that
   case, so this is implemented once for all clients? not sure

⏺ Great point! If we're managing conversation state internally, we definitely need shared
   implementation.

  Should the conversation state be managed by:

  1. Base class approach - abstract class ChatClient with shared conversation logic,
  providers extend it
  2. Composition approach - A separate Conversation class that providers use internally
  3. Hybrid approach - Base class for common interface + conversation manager for state

  For example:
  // Base class approach
  abstract class ChatClient {
    protected messages: Message[] = [];

    ask(prompt: string): Promise<ChatResponse> {
      this.messages.push({ role: 'user', content: prompt });
      const response = await this.sendMessages(this.messages);
      this.messages.push({ role: 'assistant', content: response.content });
      return response;
    }

    abstract sendMessages(messages: Message[]): Promise<ChatResponse>;
  }

  Which feels right to you?

> i think a separate class makes sense.

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants a separate class to manage conversation state, which makes sense from a
  composition over inheritance perspective. This would be cleaner and more flexible.

  So we'd have:
  1. A Conversation class that manages message history
  2. A ChatClient interface that providers implement
  3. Provider-specific clients that use the Conversation class internally

  Let me ask about how the conversation class should work with the chat clients.

⏺ Good choice! Composition over inheritance is cleaner here.

  How should the Conversation class interact with the ChatClient implementations? Should
  each provider client create its own conversation instance internally, or should users
  explicitly create conversations and pass them to the clients?

  For example:
  // Option 1: Client manages conversation internally
  const claude = lemmy.anthropic();
  claude.ask("Hello"); // Creates internal conversation
  claude.ask("Follow up"); // Continues same conversation

  // Option 2: Explicit conversation management
  const conversation = new Conversation();
  const claude = lemmy.anthropic();
  claude.ask("Hello", { conversation });
  claude.ask("Follow up", { conversation });

  // Option 3: Conversation as primary interface
  const conversation = lemmy.createConversation();
  conversation.ask("Hello", { provider: 'anthropic' });

> i like the second approach best.

⏺ Perfect! The explicit conversation approach gives users full control over conversation
  lifecycle.

  Should conversations be provider-agnostic (can switch between providers within the same
   conversation) or provider-specific (locked to one provider once first message is
  sent)?

  For example:
  // Provider-agnostic conversation
  const conversation = new Conversation();
  claude.ask("Hello", { conversation });
  openai.ask("Follow up", { conversation }); // Mixed providers in same conversation

  // vs Provider-specific conversation
  const conversation = new Conversation();
  claude.ask("Hello", { conversation }); // Locks to Anthropic
  openai.ask("Follow up", { conversation }); // Error or creates new conversation

  The provider-agnostic approach is more flexible but could be confusing since different
  providers have different capabilities and message formats.

> provider agnostic. though we will need to make sure that tool specs can also be
  specified in a single format across all providers. i suppose i also want to support
  tool calls into mcp servers. i want all this to be as simple as possible.

⏺ Excellent! Provider-agnostic conversations with unified tool specs and MCP server
  support will make agentic workflows very powerful.

  For tool definitions, should we use a single unified schema that gets translated to
  each provider's format, or adopt one provider's schema as the standard (like OpenAI's
  function calling format) since it's widely supported?

  For example:
  // Unified tool definition
  const weatherTool = {
    name: "get_weather",
    description: "Get current weather",
    parameters: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        location: { type: "string", description: "City name" }
      }
    }
  };

  // Works across all providers + MCP servers
  conversation.ask("What's the weather in NYC?", {
    tools: [weatherTool],
    conversation
  });

> i think we should adopt the mcp tools spec maybe?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is suggesting adopting the MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools spec as the
  standard for tool definitions. This makes a lot of sense since:

  1. They want to support MCP servers directly
  2. MCP is designed to be a unified protocol for tools/functions
  3. It would provide consistency between native tools and MCP server tools
  4. MCP is gaining adoption and is designed to be provider-agnostic

  I should ask about this choice and understand how they envision the integration
  working.

⏺ Great idea! Using the MCP tools spec as the standard would provide seamless integration
   between native tools and MCP servers.

  How should the MCP server integration work - should lemmy automatically discover and
  connect to MCP servers (like through a config file), or should users explicitly
  register MCP servers they want to use in their conversations?

  For example:
  // Auto-discovery approach
  // lemmy reads ~/.mcp/config.json and connects to all servers

  // vs Explicit registration
  const conversation = new Conversation();
  conversation.addMCPServer("filesystem", { transport: "stdio", command: "mcp-fs" });
  conversation.ask("List files in my project", { conversation });

  // vs Per-request
  claude.ask("List files", {
    conversation,
    mcpServers: ["filesystem", "git"]
  });

> definintely explicit registration.

⏺ Perfect! Explicit registration gives users full control over which capabilities are
  available.

  Should MCP servers be registered at the conversation level (each conversation can have
  different MCP servers) or at the client level (all conversations from a client share
  the same MCP servers)?

  For example:
  // Conversation-level registration
  const conversation = new Conversation();
  conversation.addMCPServer("filesystem", { transport: "stdio", command: "mcp-fs" });

  // vs Client-level registration
  const claude = lemmy.anthropic();
  claude.addMCPServer("filesystem", { transport: "stdio", command: "mcp-fs" });
  // All conversations using this client have access to filesystem tools

  // vs Both levels supported
  const claude = lemmy.anthropic();
  claude.addMCPServer("git", { ... }); // Available to all conversations
  const conversation = new Conversation();
  conversation.addMCPServer("filesystem", { ... }); // Only this conversation

> i think it should be managed by conversation. however, conversation might be a
  misnormer. it's really context, which consists of the conversation history, and
  available tools.

✻ Thinking…

  The user makes an excellent point! "Conversation" is misleading when it also manages
  tools and MCP servers. "Context" is much more accurate - it encompasses the
  conversation history, available tools (both native and MCP), and probably other
  contextual information like system instructions.

  This is a much better abstraction name. Let me ask about what should be included in
  this Context class.

⏺ Excellent point! Context is much more accurate since it manages conversation history,
  tools, MCP servers, and potentially other contextual state.

  What else should the Context class manage beyond conversation history and tools? Should
   it also handle system instructions, temperature/model overrides, or other
  conversation-scoped settings?

  For example:
  const context = new Context();
  context.addMCPServer("filesystem", { ... });
  context.addTool(weatherTool);
  context.setSystemInstructions("You are a helpful coding assistant");
  context.setTemperature(0.7);

  // Everything is scoped to this context
  claude.ask("Help me code", { context });
  openai.ask("Follow up question", { context }); // Same context, different provider

> i think temperature, top-p, whatever is provider specific. e.g. some models might not
  allow temp settings, etc. so the context should really just keep track of the things we
   already discussed.

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect, so the Context class should be focused on the core contextual state that works
   across all providers:
  1. Conversation history (messages)
  2. Available tools (in MCP format)
  3. MCP server connections

  Provider-specific settings like temperature, top-p, etc. should be handled at the
  individual request level or client level, not in the shared context.

  Let me ask about how the actual tool execution should work - this is a key part of
  agentic workflows.

⏺ Perfect! So Context stays clean and focused on the provider-agnostic state:
  conversation history, tools, and MCP servers.

  For tool execution during conversations, should lemmy automatically execute tools when
  the model requests them, or should users have control over the execution flow?

  For example:
  // Automatic execution
  const context = new Context();
  context.addTool(weatherTool);
  const response = await claude.ask("What's the weather in NYC?", { context });
  // Tool automatically executed, result fed back to model, final response returned

  // vs Manual control
  const response = await claude.ask("What's the weather in NYC?", { context });
  if (response.toolCalls) {
    const toolResults = await context.executePendingTools();
    const finalResponse = await claude.continue({ context, toolResults });
  }

> how does ruby_llm do it?

⏺ From the ruby_llm documentation I reviewed earlier, it uses automatic execution:

  chat = RubyLLM.chat(model: 'gpt-4')
  chat.ask("What's the weather in NYC?", tools: [weather_tool])
  # Tool is automatically executed, result fed back to model, final response returned

  The model determines when tools are needed, ruby_llm executes them automatically, feeds
   the results back to the model, and returns the final natural language response to the
  user.

  Should lemmy follow this automatic execution pattern for simplicity, or would you
  prefer manual control for more complex agentic workflows where you might want to
  inspect or modify tool calls before execution?

> i think lemmy should do automatic by default, with an optional callback that allows
  user intervention maybe?

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants automatic tool execution by default (following ruby_llm's pattern for
  simplicity), but with an optional callback for user intervention when needed. This is a
   great balance - simple by default, but flexible for advanced use cases.

  Let me ask about how this callback should work - what parameters it should receive and
  what control it should provide.

⏺ Excellent approach! Automatic by default keeps it simple, but the callback provides
  escape hatches for complex workflows.

  What should the tool execution callback receive and return? Should it be able to modify
   tool calls, cancel execution, or provide custom results?

  For example:
  const context = new Context();
  context.addTool(weatherTool);

  // Simple callback - just observe
  claude.ask("Weather in NYC?", {
    context,
    onToolCall: (toolCall) => console.log('Executing:', toolCall.name)
  });

  // Advanced callback - can modify/cancel/override
  claude.ask("Weather in NYC?", {
    context,
    onToolCall: async (toolCall) => {
      if (toolCall.name === 'dangerous_operation') {
        return { cancelled: true };
      }
      return { proceed: true, modifiedArgs: { ...toolCall.args, safeMode: true } };
    }
  });

> it should definitely get the tool call info itself and provide a way to abort
  execution. it should not be able to modify args. in terms of return, it should just
  return true or false, which signals if execution should continue.

⏺ Perfect! Clean and simple - just approve/deny execution.

  Should the callback be synchronous or asynchronous? And when exactly should it be
  called - before each individual tool execution, or once for all tool calls if the model
   requests multiple tools in a single response?

  For example:
  // Per-tool callback
  claude.ask("Book a flight and hotel", {
    context,
    onToolCall: (toolCall: ToolCall) => boolean // Called twice if model requests both
  tools
  });

  // vs Batch callback
  claude.ask("Book a flight and hotel", {
    context,
    onToolCall: (toolCalls: ToolCall[]) => boolean[] // Called once with array
  });

  // Async version
  claude.ask("Weather in NYC?", {
    context,
    onToolCall: async (toolCall: ToolCall) => Promise<boolean>
  });

> callback once per call. i think async makes sense, as that might trigger a UI
  interaction with a user?

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants:
  - Callback once per tool call (not batched)
  - Async callback (makes sense for UI interactions)
  - Callback receives tool call info
  - Returns true/false to approve/deny execution

  This is a clean design that allows for user intervention when needed.

  Next logical question would be about error handling during tool execution, or maybe
  about the overall API structure/entry point for lemmy. Let me think about what would be
   most valuable to nail down next in the spec.

  I think we should ask about error handling during tool execution - what happens when a
  tool fails? Does it get fed back to the model, does it throw an exception, etc.

⏺ Perfect! Async callback per tool call gives maximum flexibility for user interactions.

  How should lemmy handle tool execution errors? Should failed tool calls be fed back to
  the model with error details, throw exceptions to the user, or provide some other error
   handling mechanism?

  For example:
  // Feed errors back to model
  const weatherTool = {
    execute: async () => { throw new Error("API down"); }
  };
  // Model receives: "Tool execution failed: API down" and can respond accordingly

  // vs Throw to user
  claude.ask("Weather in NYC?", { context }); // Throws ToolExecutionError

  // vs Error callback
  claude.ask("Weather in NYC?", {
    context,
    onToolCall: async (toolCall) => true,
    onToolError: async (toolCall, error) => "continue" | "abort" | "retry"
  });

> what makes for simpler code when creating agentic workflows?

⏺ For agentic workflows, feeding errors back to the model creates much simpler code
  because:

  1. Self-healing agents - The model can retry with different parameters, try alternative
   approaches, or gracefully handle failures
  2. No exception handling - Developers don't need try/catch blocks around every agent
  interaction
  3. Natural error recovery - The model can explain what went wrong to the user in
  natural language
  4. Resilient workflows - One tool failure doesn't crash the entire agent flow

  // Simple - just ask, model handles everything
  const response = await claude.ask("Book me a flight to Paris and check weather", {
  context });
  // If flight API is down, model might say "I couldn't book the flight due to API
  issues, but here's the weather..."

  // vs Complex exception handling
  try {
    const response = await claude.ask("Book flight and check weather", { context });
  } catch (ToolExecutionError) {
    // Handle each possible tool failure...
  }

  Should tool execution errors always be fed back to the model, or would you want an
  option to throw exceptions for certain critical failures?

> i think we should follow the callback pattern like we do for the tool call itself. by
  default, the error should be fed back to the model, but the user of the api should be
  able to intercept? i would love a general error reporting and handling solution. e.g.
  ask itself could fail, e.g. because the model is down. anything that makes using the
  API easier is best

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants a general error reporting and handling solution that makes the API
  easier to use. They like the callback pattern for both tool execution approval and
  error handling. They're thinking about different types of errors:

  1. Tool execution errors (API down, invalid params, etc.)
  2. Model/provider errors (model down, rate limits, etc.)
  3. Network/connection errors
  4. Authentication errors

  They want:
  - Default behavior that keeps things simple (errors fed back to model for tool errors)
  - Callback pattern for interception when needed
  - Consistent error handling across all error types
  - Easy to use API

  I should ask about how they want to handle the different error categories and whether
  they want a unified error handling approach across all error types.

⏺ Excellent thinking! A unified error handling strategy across all failure points would
  make the API much more reliable and easier to use.

  Should lemmy use a consistent callback pattern for all error types (tool execution
  failures, model API failures, network issues, etc.), or handle different error
  categories differently?

  For example:
  // Unified error handling
  claude.ask("Book flight to Paris", {
    context,
    onToolCall: async (toolCall) => true,
    onError: async (error: LemmyError) => {
      switch (error.type) {
        case 'tool_execution': return 'feed_to_model';
        case 'model_api': return 'retry';
        case 'network': return 'abort';
        case 'auth': throw error; // Can't recover
      }
    }
  });

  // vs Category-specific handling
  claude.ask("Book flight", {
    context,
    onToolError: async (toolCall, error) => 'feed_to_model',
    onModelError: async (error) => 'retry',
    onNetworkError: async (error) => 'abort'
  });

> what does ruby_llm do?

⏺ From the ruby_llm documentation I analyzed, it doesn't show detailed error handling
  patterns. The docs focus on the happy path - successful tool execution and model
  responses.

  However, ruby_llm does mention that tool interactions can have "multi-phase streaming"
  and that there's error handling during the streaming process, but the specific error
  handling strategy isn't detailed in the guides I reviewed.

  Since ruby_llm doesn't provide a clear pattern here, what approach feels most natural
  to you - the unified error callback that handles all error types, or separate callbacks
   for different error categories? Or should we start simple with just basic error
  propagation and add sophisticated error handling later?

> i think category specific makes the most sense. also in terms of extensibility and
  maintenance fo code that uses the library. i want to keep the options minimal at first
  though.

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants category-specific error handling but minimal options at first. That
  makes sense - they can add more error categories as needed without breaking the API.

  Let me think about what the minimal set would be:
  1. Tool execution errors (since we already discussed tool callbacks)
  2. Model/API errors (since models can go down, rate limits, etc.)

  Network errors could probably be grouped under model errors for now. Auth errors too.

  So maybe just:
  - onToolError for tool execution failures
  - onModelError for API/model failures

  And the user can expand this later as needed.

⏺ Perfect! Category-specific with minimal options to start gives a clean foundation that
  can expand.

  What would be the minimal essential error categories to start with? I'm thinking:

  1. onToolError - for tool execution failures
  2. onModelError - for model API failures (rate limits, downtime, auth, etc.)

  claude.ask("Book flight to Paris", {
    context,
    onToolCall: async (toolCall) => true,
    onToolError: async (toolCall, error) => 'feed_to_model' | 'abort',
    onModelError: async (error) => 'retry' | 'abort'
  });

  Does this minimal set cover the main failure scenarios you're thinking about, or are
  there other critical error categories we should include from the start?

> can you think of any other critical error categories not covered by these 2?

✻ Thinking…

  Let me think about the different types of errors that could occur in an LLM API
  wrapper:

  1. Tool execution errors - covered by onToolError
  2. Model API errors - covered by onModelError (this would include things like rate
  limits, API downtime, authentication failures, invalid requests, etc.)

  What other error categories could there be?

  3. Network/connectivity errors - But these might be considered a subset of model API
  errors? If the network is down, you can't reach the model API.
  4. MCP server errors - These could be different from regular tool errors since MCP
  servers are external processes. Connection failures, protocol errors, etc.
  5. Configuration/setup errors - Invalid API keys, malformed tool definitions, etc. But
  these might be better as thrown exceptions since they're developer errors.
  6. Validation errors - Invalid parameters, malformed requests. Again, might be better
  as exceptions.
  7. Context/conversation errors - Like trying to use a context that's been corrupted or
  has incompatible state.

  Actually, thinking about it more:
  - Network errors are usually just a subset of model API errors
  - Configuration/validation errors should probably just throw exceptions since they're
  programming errors
  - Context errors could be exceptions too

  The one that stands out is MCP server errors - these could be quite different from
  regular tool errors. MCP servers are separate processes that could crash, become
  unresponsive, have transport issues, etc.

  But maybe we should start minimal and add MCP error handling later when we implement
  that feature?

⏺ Looking at the error flow, I think those two categories cover the main cases:

  - Network errors are typically just a subset of model API errors
  - Configuration errors (invalid API keys, malformed tools) should probably throw
  exceptions since they're programming errors
  - MCP server errors could be distinct (server crashes, transport failures), but maybe
  we add that later when implementing MCP support?

  Should we start with just onToolError and onModelError, and add MCP-specific error
  handling when we implement MCP integration, or include onMCPError from the beginning
  even if it's not used initially?

> i think an mcp error is just a tool error really. i'm now not sure if this is the best
  way to go about it though. the callbacks might complicate API use. also, if 'abort' is
  returned by any of the error callbacks, what is returned from ask?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is raising a good point about the complexity of the callback-based error
  handling. Let me think about this:

  1. If an error callback returns 'abort', what does the main ask() method return? This
  creates an awkward API design issue.
  2. The callbacks might make the API more complex rather than simpler, which goes
  against the goal of making agentic workflows simple.
  3. Maybe a simpler approach would be better - like having sensible defaults for error
  handling and only allowing customization for specific advanced cases.

  Let me think about what would be simpler:
  - Default behavior: tool errors feed back to model, model errors get retried once then
  thrown
  - Advanced users can override this if needed
  - This keeps the simple case simple

  Or maybe just throw exceptions for all errors and let users catch them if they want
  custom handling? That's actually simpler than callbacks.

⏺ Great point! You're right - the callbacks could make the API more complex rather than
  simpler.

  What if we went with sensible defaults and exceptions instead? For example:

  // Simple case - just works with good defaults
  const response = await claude.ask("Book flight", { context });

  // Advanced case - custom error handling
  try {
    const response = await claude.ask("Book flight", { context });
  } catch (ToolError | ModelError) {
    // Handle as needed
  }

  With defaults like:
  - Tool errors → feed back to model
  - Model API errors → retry once, then throw
  - Critical errors → always throw

  Would this approach be simpler than callbacks while still giving users control when
  they need it?

> so, in case of a model error, i might want to retry. in case of a tool error, i might
  want to report to the model, or abort and give control back to a user in a chat for
  example. additionally, i need a way to intercept tool calls and either auto execute, or
   ask something else (user, sub-system) if the tool call should continue.

  maybe it makes sense to handle all this with the return value of ask? it should
  indicate what happened maybe? i'm entirely unsure. i just feel that the callback
  mechanism will lead to spaghetti code that is hard to debug.

⏺ You're absolutely right about callbacks leading to spaghetti code! A structured return
  value that indicates what happened would be much cleaner and easier to debug.

  What if ask() returns a result object that tells you exactly what happened and what
  options you have?

  const result = await claude.ask("Book flight", { context });

  if (result.type === 'success') {
    console.log(result.response);
  } else if (result.type === 'tool_call_pending') {
    const shouldExecute = await askUser(result.toolCall);
    if (shouldExecute) {
      const finalResult = await result.execute();
    }
  } else if (result.type === 'tool_error') {
    const retry = await result.feedToModel() || await result.abort();
  } else if (result.type === 'model_error') {
    const retry = await result.retry() || throw result.error;
  }

  Does this kind of explicit result-based flow feel more manageable than callbacks for
  building agentic workflows?

> i like it for the most part. what's iffy is that result would need to reference the
  model instance and know how to execute a tool. tool execution is likely implemented by
  context i'd assume. then something else (in this csae result) would have to feed that
  back to the model.

⏺ You're absolutely right - the result object having to know about model instances and
  tool execution creates tight coupling and weird dependencies.

  What if we keep the result simple as just data/status, and put the action methods on
  the Context or ChatClient instead?

  const result = await claude.ask("Book flight", { context });

  if (result.type === 'tool_call_pending') {
    const shouldExecute = await askUser(result.toolCall);
    if (shouldExecute) {
      const finalResult = await context.executeAndContinue(claude, result.toolCall);
    }
  } else if (result.type === 'tool_error') {
    const retryResult = await context.feedErrorToModel(claude, result.error);
  }

  Or even simpler - just return the status/data, and the user calls the client again with
   additional context about how to proceed?

> what would your last option look like? those if block cascades are very ugly. for use
  cases where we assume a happy path, it makes the code meh.

⏺ You're right, those cascades are ugly. Here's what the simpler approach could look
  like:

  // Happy path - just works
  const response = await claude.ask("Book flight", { context });
  // If tools needed, auto-executed; if errors, sensible defaults applied

  // Manual control when needed
  const result = await claude.ask("Book flight", { context, autoExecute: false });
  if (result.toolCallsNeeded) {
    // Decide what to do, then:
    const response = await claude.ask("continue", { context, executeTools: true });
  }

  But even this feels clunky. What if we had two different methods - one for simple happy
   path usage, and one for manual control?

  // Simple - handles everything automatically
  const response = await claude.chat("Book flight", { context });

  // Manual - gives you control points
  for await (const step of claude.chatSteps("Book flight", { context })) {
    if (step.needsToolExecution) {
      step.proceed(await askUser(step.toolCall));
    }
  }

> so i think auto execute is not great. i think ask should return success, model error,
  tool error, and tool call. in case of tool call, context.executePendingTool() will do
  the execution and add the result to its conversation history. it really defpends on how
   tool call results must be communicated back to the llm. is that similar across
  providers?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking about how tool call results are communicated back to LLMs across
  different providers. This is a good question because different providers handle tool
  calling differently:

  1. OpenAI: Uses function calling where the model requests a function call, you execute
  it, then send the result back as a message with role "function" or "tool"
  2. Anthropic: Uses tool use where the model requests tool use, you execute it, then
  send back a tool_result message
  3. Google: Has similar patterns with function calling
  4. Ollama: Depends on the underlying model, but typically follows OpenAI patterns

  The key insight is that yes, the pattern is quite similar across providers - the model
  requests tool execution, you run the tool, then you need to send the result back to the
   model in the next message. The format differs slightly but the flow is consistent.

  So the user's idea of context.executePendingTool() executing the tool and adding the
  result to conversation history makes sense, because then when you call ask() again, the
   context will include that tool result in the message history sent to the model.

  This is actually a very clean API design.

⏺ Yes! Tool calling flow is very similar across providers:

  1. Model requests tool - Returns tool call with name/args
  2. You execute tool - Run the tool with provided args
  3. Send result back - Add tool result to conversation as a message
  4. Model continues - Processes the tool result and responds

  The message format differs slightly (OpenAI uses role: "tool", Anthropic uses
  tool_result, etc.) but the flow is identical.

  So your approach is really clean:

  const result = await claude.ask("Book flight", { context });

  if (result.type === 'tool_call') {
    const shouldExecute = await askUser(result.toolCall);
    if (shouldExecute) {
      await context.executePendingTool(); // Adds result to conversation history
      const finalResult = await claude.ask("continue", { context }); // Model sees tool
  result
    }
  }

  Should executePendingTool() execute all pending tool calls, or should users be able to
  execute them individually if the model requested multiple tools?

> i guess the user should be able to inspect all pending tool calls, and do whatever they
   think is beset with them, i.e. execute in parallel, whatever.

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants flexibility where users can inspect all pending tool calls and decide
  how to handle them - execute in parallel, selectively, etc. This makes sense for
  complex agentic workflows.

  So the API would be something like:

  const result = await claude.ask("Book flight and check weather", { context });

  if (result.type === 'tool_call') {
    console.log(result.toolCalls); // Array of pending tool calls

    // Execute individually
    await context.executeTool(result.toolCalls[0]);

    // Or execute multiple/all
    await context.executeTools([...result.toolCalls]);

    // Or execute in parallel
    await Promise.all(result.toolCalls.map(tc => context.executeTool(tc)));

    const finalResult = await claude.ask("continue", { context });
  }

  This gives maximum flexibility. The context keeps track of which tools have been
  executed and their results.

  My next question should probably be about what the Context API looks like for tool
  execution - should it have methods like executeTool(toolCall), executeTools(toolCalls),
   getPendingTools(), etc.

⏺ Perfect! Maximum flexibility for complex workflows.

  const result = await claude.ask("Book flight and check weather", { context });

  if (result.type === 'tool_call') {
    console.log(result.toolCalls); // Array of all pending tool calls

    // Execute selectively
    await context.executeTool(result.toolCalls[0]);

    // Or in parallel
    await Promise.all(result.toolCalls.map(tc => context.executeTool(tc)));

    const finalResult = await claude.ask("continue", { context });
  }

  What should the Context tool execution API look like? Should it have methods like
  executeTool(toolCall), executeTools(toolCalls), getPendingTools(), or keep it simpler
  with just executeTool() that takes a single tool call?

> i like what i see in your snippet

⏺ Great! So we have a solid foundation now. Let me make sure I understand the core
  architecture:

  ChatClient interface with provider implementations (AnthropicClient, OpenAIClient,
  etc.), Context class managing conversation history and tools, explicit tool execution
  with user control, and structured return types from ask() indicating
  success/tool_call/model_error/tool_error.

  What should we tackle next for the specification - the detailed TypeScript types for
  messages, tool definitions, and return values, or the provider configuration and
  authentication setup?

> let's tackle provider configuration first. we need to gather information about
  available models from somewhere. the ruby_llm project does this for us. we can find an
  up-to-date list of models here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crmne/ruby_llm/refs/he
  ads/main/lib/ruby_llm/models.json. please access this file and read it (or parts of it)

⏺ Fetch(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crmne/ruby_llm/refs/heads/main/lib/ruby_llm/mo…
       els.json)
  ⎿  Received 745.5KB (200 OK)

⏺ Perfect! The ruby_llm models.json provides a great foundation. The structure looks very
   comprehensive with consistent metadata across providers.

  Should lemmy consume this models.json file directly (perhaps fetching it at runtime or
  bundling it), create our own simplified version, or use it as a starting point and
  maintain our own model registry?

  The ruby_llm file has detailed pricing info and capabilities, but we might want to:
  - Add TypeScript-specific fields
  - Filter to only models we support
  - Add custom metadata for our use cases

  What's your preference for model discovery and management?

> ruby_llm periodically updates its models.json file, then generates code from it. i want
   to do the same, for the providers and models with text input/output modalities. this
  way, a user of the API can select models in a type safe way. we also want to record the
   pricing so the API can help with cost estimates as well.

⏺ Perfect! Code generation from the models.json will give us type safety and automatic
  updates.

  What should the generated TypeScript code look like? Should we generate:

  1. String literal union types for each provider's models?
  type AnthropicModels = 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022' | 'claude-3-5-haiku-20241022' |
  ...;
  type OpenAIModels = 'gpt-4o' | 'gpt-4o-mini' | ...;

  2. Model objects with metadata for runtime access?
  export const AnthropicModels = {
    'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022': {
      contextWindow: 200000,
      pricing: { inputPerMillion: 3, outputPerMillion: 15 }
    },
    // ...
  } as const;

  3. Both - types for compile-time safety + objects for runtime metadata?

  And should this be one big generated file, or separate files per provider?

> option 3, and it should be one big generated file. the generator should be a simple
  JAvaScript file in scripts/update-models.js. we can later set up a CI action that
  periodically updates this. that's a detail to be tackled later. assume i'll manually
  execute this for now and update the generated code accordingly.

⏺ Perfect! So we'll have a scripts/update-models.js that fetches the ruby_llm
  models.json, filters for text-only models, and generates TypeScript types + runtime
  objects.

  What should the structure of the generated file look like? Should it be organized like
  this:

  // Generated file: src/model.ts

  // Types
  export type AnthropicModels = 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022' |
  'claude-3-5-haiku-20241022';
  export type OpenAIModels = 'gpt-4o' | 'gpt-4o-mini';
  export type GoogleModels = 'gemini-1.5-pro' | 'gemini-1.5-flash';
  export type OllamaModels = string; // Since these are dynamic/user-defined

  // Runtime objects
  export const AnthropicModelData = { /* ... */ } as const;
  export const OpenAIModelData = { /* ... */ } as const;
  export const GoogleModelData = { /* ... */ } as const;

  // Union of all models
  export type AllModels = AnthropicModels | OpenAIModels | GoogleModels | OllamaModels;

  And should the script filter models by checking for text-only input/output modalities,
  or use some other criteria?

> it should filter models that have text input and output (and might also have image
  input, we simply won't use this capability for now). we also need to store whether the
  model supports tools.

⏺ Perfect! So we filter for models with text output + text input (ignoring additional
  image input for now), and track tool support.

  For the tool capability detection, should the script look for specific strings in the
  capabilities array from the models.json (like "function_calling", "tools", etc.), or is
   there a more reliable field to check?

  And for the generated structure:

  // Types
  export type AnthropicModels = 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022' |
  'claude-3-5-haiku-20241022';

  // Runtime objects
  export const AnthropicModelData = {
    'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022': {
      contextWindow: 200000,
      maxOutputTokens: 8192,
      supportsTools: true,
      pricing: { inputPerMillion: 3, outputPerMillion: 15 }
    }
  } as const;

  Should we also generate helper functions like getModelData(model: AllModels) or keep it
   simple with just the exported objects?

> exported objects is totally fine, no need to complicate this.

⏺ Great! So the generator will be straightforward - just types and data objects.

  One more detail about the script: should it download the models.json fresh each time it
   runs, or should we have it save a local copy that we can version control to track
  changes over time?

  // Option 1: Always fetch fresh
  const response = await fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crmne/ruby_llm/refs/hea
  ds/main/lib/ruby_llm/models.json');

  // Option 2: Save local copy
  // Download to models.json, generate from local file, commit both

  Either way works - just wondering if you want to track the source data in git or always
   pull the latest.

> always fetch

⏺ Perfect! Now I have a clear picture of the lemmy specification:

  Summary:
  - TypeScript API wrapper inspired by ruby_llm
  - Provider-specific clients (anthropic(), openai(), google(), ollama()) implementing
  ChatClient interface
  - Context class managing conversation history, tools, and MCP servers
  - Explicit tool execution with user control via context.executeTool()
  - Structured return types from ask() (success/tool_call/model_error/tool_error)
  - Code generation from ruby_llm models.json for type-safe model selection
  - MCP tools spec for unified tool definitions
  - Provider-agnostic conversations with automatic message format translation

  Is there anything else about the core architecture or API design you'd like to specify
  before we could hand this off to a developer, or does this cover the essential
  foundation?

> we haven't talked about how to instantiate a client based on model name, how to
  configure API keys, etc.

⏺ Great point! We need the bootstrapping and configuration details.

  For client instantiation, should lemmy automatically route based on model name, or
  require explicit provider selection?

  For example:
  // Auto-routing approach
  const client = lemmy.clientForModel('claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022'); // Returns
  AnthropicClient
  const client = lemmy.clientForModel('gpt-4o'); // Returns OpenAIClient

  // vs Explicit provider approach
  const claude = lemmy.anthropic();
  claude.ask("Hello", { model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022' });

  // vs Both supported
  const claude = lemmy.anthropic(); // Explicit
  const auto = lemmy.clientForModel('gpt-4o'); // Auto-routing

  And for API keys, should they be passed during client creation, read from environment
  variables, or both?

> api keys passed during client creation. i assume each provider impl would have
  additional options we can pass during creation?

⏺ Perfect! So provider-specific configuration at client creation.

  const claude = lemmy.anthropic({
    apiKey: 'sk-...',
    // Anthropic-specific options like baseURL, etc.
  });

  const openai = lemmy.openai({
    apiKey: 'sk-...',
    organization: 'org-...', // OpenAI-specific
    // etc.
  });

  For model selection within each client, should the model be specified per ask() call,
  set once during client creation, or both?

  // Per-call model selection
  claude.ask("Hello", { model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', context });

  // vs Client-level default with optional override
  const claude = lemmy.anthropic({ apiKey: '...', defaultModel:
  'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022' });
  claude.ask("Hello", { context }); // Uses default
  claude.ask("Hello", { model: 'claude-3-5-haiku-20241022', context }); // Override

> i want to write cli apps that take a model name. with the current setup, i can't easily
   instantiate them. any ideas? can we generate models.ts in a way that we can do type
  safe generalized instantiation of the correct client for a given model name? would also
   mean provider specific options would need to be type encoded in the method signature
  somehow.

⏺ Excellent point! For CLI apps, you need a way to go from model string to the right
  client type.

  We could generate a model-to-provider mapping and a factory function that returns the
  correctly typed client:

  // Generated in models.ts
  export const ModelToProvider = {
    'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022': 'anthropic',
    'gpt-4o': 'openai',
    'gemini-1.5-pro': 'google'
  } as const;

  // Factory function with conditional types
  export function createClientForModel<T extends AllModels>(
    model: T,
    config: T extends AnthropicModels ? AnthropicConfig :
           T extends OpenAIModels ? OpenAIConfig :
           T extends GoogleModels ? GoogleConfig :
           OllamaConfig
  ): ChatClient {
    // Runtime dispatch based on ModelToProvider[model]
  }

  // Usage in CLI
  const client = createClientForModel('claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', { apiKey: '...' });

  Does this approach give you the type safety and CLI flexibility you're looking for?

> where does odel to provider com in in createClientForModel?

⏺ You're right - I didn't show how ModelToProvider is used in the implementation. Here's
  the complete picture:

  // Generated in models.ts
  export const ModelToProvider = {
    'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022': 'anthropic',
    'gpt-4o': 'openai',
    'gemini-1.5-pro': 'google'
  } as const;

  export function createClientForModel<T extends AllModels>(
    model: T,
    config: T extends AnthropicModels ? AnthropicConfig :
           T extends OpenAIModels ? OpenAIConfig :
           T extends GoogleModels ? GoogleConfig :
           OllamaConfig
  ): ChatClient {
    const provider = ModelToProvider[model]; // Runtime lookup

    switch (provider) {
      case 'anthropic': return lemmy.anthropic(config as AnthropicConfig);
      case 'openai': return lemmy.openai(config as OpenAIConfig);
      case 'google': return lemmy.google(config as GoogleConfig);
      // etc.
    }
  }

  The ModelToProvider mapping drives the runtime dispatch while the conditional types
  ensure compile-time type safety for the config parameter. Does this make sense?

> can you think of a better, simpler way to do this?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking for a simpler way to handle the model-to-client instantiation
  problem. Let me think about this...

  The current approach with conditional types and ModelToProvider mapping is quite
  complex. Let me think of simpler alternatives:

  1. Simple factory with union config type: Instead of conditional types, just accept a
  union of all config types and do runtime validation.
  2. Separate method per provider with model validation: Keep the provider-specific
  methods but add model validation.
  3. Single config interface: Make all providers use a common config interface with
  optional provider-specific fields.
  4. Runtime-only approach: Skip the fancy TypeScript types and just do runtime
  validation/dispatch.
  5. Model-first API: What if the primary interface is model-centric rather than
  provider-centric?

  Let me think about option 5 - what if instead of lemmy.anthropic() being the primary
  interface, we had lemmy.model('claude-3-5-sonnet') as the primary interface? That could
   be simpler.

  Or option 3 - what if all providers just took a common config shape like { apiKey:
  string, [key: string]: any } and we let the provider implementations sort out what they
   need?

  Or even simpler - what if we just accept any config object and let TypeScript infer
  less, but make the runtime simpler?

⏺ Yes! A few simpler approaches:

  Option 1: Common config interface
  export function createClientForModel(
    model: AllModels,
    config: { apiKey: string; [key: string]: any }
  ): ChatClient {
    // Generator creates this mapping
    if (model.startsWith('claude-')) return lemmy.anthropic(config);
    if (model.startsWith('gpt-')) return lemmy.openai(config);
    // etc.
  }

  Option 2: Model-first API
  const client = lemmy.model('claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', { apiKey: '...' });
  // Internally routes to the right provider

  Option 3: Provider methods with model validation
  const claude = lemmy.anthropic({ apiKey: '...' });
  claude.ask("Hello", { model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022' }); // Validates model at
  runtime

  Which feels most natural for CLI usage where you're passing model names as strings?

> what we need is a mapping model name -> provider specific config

⏺ Ah yes! Each model needs to know what provider-specific config it expects.

  We could generate that mapping directly:

  // Generated in models.ts
  export const ModelConfigs = {
    'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022': (config: AnthropicConfig) => lemmy.anthropic(config),
    'gpt-4o': (config: OpenAIConfig) => lemmy.openai(config),
    'gemini-1.5-pro': (config: GoogleConfig) => lemmy.google(config),
  } as const;

  // Usage
  const clientFactory = ModelConfigs['claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022'];
  const client = clientFactory({ apiKey: '...', baseURL: '...' }); // TypeScript knows
  this needs AnthropicConfig

  Or even simpler - generate a direct factory function per model:

  export const Models = {
    'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022': (config: AnthropicConfig) => lemmy.anthropic(config),
    'gpt-4o': (config: OpenAIConfig) => lemmy.openai(config),
  } as const;

  Does this direction feel right for CLI usage?

> no. in models.ts we have:

  - the model names
  - for each model it's provider which comes from a fixed set (anthropic, google, openai,
   ollama)
  - we should be able to construct types based on this info to make createClientForModel
  typesafe wrt to the config parameter type

⏺ Ah, I see! You want to derive the config type from the model-to-provider mapping.
  Here's how:

  // Generated in models.ts
  export const ModelToProvider = {
    'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022': 'anthropic',
    'gpt-4o': 'openai',
    'gemini-1.5-pro': 'google'
  } as const;

  // Type mapping from provider to config
  type ProviderConfigs = {
    anthropic: AnthropicConfig;
    openai: OpenAIConfig;
    google: GoogleConfig;
    ollama: OllamaConfig;
  };

  // Derive config type from model name
  type ConfigForModel<T extends AllModels> = ProviderConfigs[ModelToProvider[T]];

  // Now createClientForModel can be fully type-safe
  export function createClientForModel<T extends AllModels>(
    model: T,
    config: ConfigForModel<T>
  ): ChatClient {
    const provider = ModelToProvider[model];
    // Runtime dispatch...
  }

  This way TypeScript knows that 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022' requires AnthropicConfig,
  right?

> that's what i want. but does this work with typescript's type system?

⏺ Yes, this should work! TypeScript's conditional types and mapped types can handle this
  pattern. Let me trace through it:

  // When you call:
  createClientForModel('claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', config)

  // TypeScript resolves:
  // T = 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022'
  // ModelToProvider['claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022'] = 'anthropic'
  // ProviderConfigs['anthropic'] = AnthropicConfig
  // So config parameter must be AnthropicConfig

  The key requirements:
  1. ModelToProvider must be as const (✓)
  2. ProviderConfigs mapping exists (✓)
  3. All model names are in the ModelToProvider keys (✓)

  Want me to create a simple test to verify this works, or are you confident this
  type-level programming will work as expected?

> lgtm. alright, i think we got it all figured out. can you please summarize our key
  findings?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking for a summary of all the key findings from our conversation about
  the lemmy API design. Let me go through the conversation and capture all the important
  decisions we made:

  1. Core concept: TypeScript API wrapper inspired by ruby_llm for agentic workflows
  2. Provider support: Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Ollama
  3. Architecture patterns: Provider-specific clients with common interface
  4. Naming: ChatClient interface (not ILLMClient), with room for future EmbeddingClient,
   etc.
  5. Conversation management: Context class (not Conversation) managing history + tools +
   MCP servers
  6. Tool handling: MCP tools spec, explicit registration, automatic execution with user
  callback control
  7. Error handling: Category-specific (onToolError, onModelError) with structured return
   types
  8. Return types: ask() returns success/tool_call/model_error/tool_error
  9. Tool execution: context.executeTool() for individual tool control
  10. Model management: Code generation from ruby_llm models.json
  11. Type safety: Generated types for model names + runtime data objects
  12. Configuration: API keys at client creation, provider-specific options
  13. CLI support: createClientForModel with type-safe config parameter based on
  model-to-provider mapping

  Let me organize this into a clear summary.

⏺ Lemmy API Specification Summary

  Core Architecture

  - TypeScript API wrapper inspired by ruby_llm for building agentic workflows
  - Provider-specific clients (lemmy.anthropic(), lemmy.openai(), lemmy.google(),
  lemmy.ollama()) implementing common ChatClient interface
  - Context class manages conversation history, tools, and MCP server connections
  (provider-agnostic)

  Conversation Flow

  - Explicit tool execution: ask() returns structured results (success, tool_call,
  model_error, tool_error)
  - User-controlled tool execution: context.executeTool(toolCall) for individual tool
  control
  - Automatic by default with async callbacks for intervention: onToolCall: async
  (toolCall) => boolean

  Tool & Agent Support

  - MCP tools specification for unified tool definitions across providers
  - MCP server integration via explicit registration at Context level
  - Provider-agnostic conversations with automatic message format translation

  Model Management

  - Code generation from ruby_llm's models.json via scripts/update-models.js
  - Type-safe model selection with generated string literal unions per provider
  - Runtime metadata including pricing, context windows, and tool support

  Configuration & CLI Support

  - Provider-specific configuration at client creation with API keys and options
  - Type-safe model factory: createClientForModel(model, config) where config type is
  derived from model name using ModelToProvider mapping
  - Generated model-to-provider mapping enables CLI apps to instantiate correct clients
  from model strings

  Error Handling

  - Category-specific error callbacks: onToolError, onModelError
  - Sensible defaults: tool errors feed back to model, model errors retry then throw
  - Structured return types avoid callback spaghetti code for complex workflows

> we said no callbacks, we simply use the ask() return type.

⏺ You're absolutely right! Let me correct that:

> we haven't specified tools yet

⏺ You're absolutely right! We discussed using the MCP tools spec but never detailed the
  actual tool definition format or execution interface.

  What should the tool definition look like in lemmy? Should we follow the MCP spec
  exactly, or adapt it for better TypeScript ergonomics?

  For example:
  // MCP-style tool definition
  const weatherTool = {
    name: "get_weather",
    description: "Get current weather for a location",
    inputSchema: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        location: { type: "string", description: "City name" }
      },
      required: ["location"]
    }
  };

  // How should execution work?
  context.addTool(weatherTool, async (args) => {
    // Tool implementation
    return await fetchWeather(args.location);
  });

  And should tools be added to Context with their implementation, or defined separately
  from execution?

> how could we make specs better wrt to typescript ergonomics?

⏺ We could make tool specs more TypeScript-friendly in several ways:

  1. Use TypeScript types instead of JSON Schema:
  // Instead of JSON Schema
  const weatherTool = {
    name: "get_weather",
    description: "Get current weather for a location",
    inputSchema: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        location: { type: "string", description: "City name" }
      }
    }
  };

  // TypeScript-first approach
  interface WeatherArgs {
    location: string;
  }

  const weatherTool = defineTool({
    name: "get_weather",
    description: "Get current weather for a location",
    execute: async (args: WeatherArgs) => {
      return await fetchWeather(args.location);
    }
  });

  2. Or use a builder pattern with type inference:
  const weatherTool = tool('get_weather')
    .description('Get current weather for a location')
    .parameter('location', z.string().describe('City name'))
    .execute(async ({ location }) => fetchWeather(location));

  Which approach feels more natural for TypeScript developers - the interface-based
  approach or a builder pattern?

> the spec needs to be mapped to provider specific encoding. can we do that with the
  typescript first approach?

⏺ Good point! The TypeScript-first approach would need to generate the provider-specific
  JSON Schema that each LLM API expects.

  We could use TypeScript reflection or a runtime schema library to bridge this gap:

  // Option 1: Runtime reflection (complex)
  interface WeatherArgs {
    location: string;
  }

  const weatherTool = defineTool({
    name: "get_weather",
    description: "Get weather",
    argsType: {} as WeatherArgs, // Type marker
    execute: async (args: WeatherArgs) => fetchWeather(args.location)
  });
  // Would need complex runtime type extraction

  // Option 2: Schema library (Zod/etc)
  const weatherTool = defineTool({
    name: "get_weather",
    description: "Get weather",
    schema: z.object({
      location: z.string().describe("City name")
    }),
    execute: async (args) => fetchWeather(args.location) // args auto-typed
  });
  // Can generate JSON Schema from Zod schema

  Would using a schema library like Zod give us both TypeScript ergonomics AND the
  ability to generate provider-specific tool definitions?

> i think it would. can you pull up the mcp tool spec schema to see how complex a tool
  definition can be?

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants to see the MCP tool specification schema to understand how complex tool
  definitions can be. This will help determine if using Zod or similar schema libraries
  can handle all the complexity of MCP tool specs while providing TypeScript ergonomics.

  I should fetch the MCP specification documentation to see the tool schema structure.

⏺ Web Search("MCP Model Context Protocol tool specification schema")…
  ⎿  Did 1 search in 25s

✻ Thinking…

  I found good overview information but I need the actual detailed tool schema
  specification. Let me fetch the specific tools specification page to see the exact
  schema structure.

⏺ Fetch(https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/server/tools)…
  ⎿  Received 261.9KB (200 OK)

✻ Thinking…

  The MCP tool schema is actually quite simple! It's just:
  - name (string, required)
  - description (string, required)
  - inputSchema (JSON Schema, required)
  - annotations (optional)

  This is much simpler than I was expecting. The inputSchema is just standard JSON
  Schema, which Zod can definitely handle. Zod can convert to JSON Schema format.

  Let me confirm this understanding and suggest how we could use Zod for this.

⏺ Great! The MCP tool schema is actually quite simple:

  Required fields:
  - name: string
  - description: string
  - inputSchema: JSON Schema object

  Optional:
  - annotations: metadata object

  This is perfect for Zod! We can define tools like this:

  const weatherTool = defineTool({
    name: "get_weather",
    description: "Get current weather for a location",
    schema: z.object({
      location: z.string().describe("City name or zip code"),
      units: z.enum(["celsius", "fahrenheit"]).optional()
    }),
    execute: async (args) => {
      // args is automatically typed as { location: string, units?: "celsius" |
  "fahrenheit" }
      return await fetchWeather(args.location, args.units);
    }
  });

  // Can generate MCP JSON Schema from Zod schema
  // Can convert to provider-specific formats (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

  Since the MCP schema is straightforward, should we stick with Zod for tool definitions,
   and have lemmy automatically convert to both MCP format and provider-specific formats
  as needed?

> i wonder how complex the input schema can get with types? what about an output schema?

⏺ Fetch(https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26)…
  ⎿  Received 132.7KB (200 OK)

⏺ Fetch(https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/2025-03-2…
       /schema.ts)
  ⎿  Received 279.3KB (200 OK)

⏺ The MCP schema is quite flexible! The input schema can be any valid JSON Schema object,
   which means it supports:

  - Complex nested objects
  - Arrays with typed items
  - Union types (anyOf, oneOf)
  - Conditional schemas (if/then/else)
  - All JSON Schema draft-07 features

  No output schema is defined - tools just return arbitrary results.

  This means Zod is perfect since it can handle all this complexity:

  const complexTool = defineTool({
    name: "complex_search",
    description: "Search with complex filters",
    schema: z.object({
      query: z.string(),
      filters: z.object({
        dateRange: z.object({
          start: z.date(),
          end: z.date()
        }).optional(),
        categories: z.array(z.enum(["tech", "science", "business"])),
        metadata: z.record(z.unknown()) // Arbitrary key-value pairs
      }),
      options: z.union([
        z.object({ format: z.literal("json"), limit: z.number() }),
        z.object({ format: z.literal("csv"), filename: z.string() })
      ])
    }),
    execute: async (args) => {
      // Fully typed complex object
    }
  });

  Should we proceed with Zod for tool definitions since it can handle the full complexity
   of JSON Schema that MCP supports?

> alright, let's go with zod then. any idea how hard it is to convert to a provider's
  specific tool/function call format?

⏺ Converting from Zod to provider formats should be straightforward since most providers
  use similar JSON Schema-based formats:

  OpenAI Functions:
  // Zod → OpenAI format
  {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Get weather",
    "parameters": zodSchema.toJsonSchema() // Direct conversion
  }

  Anthropic Tools:
  // Zod → Anthropic format
  {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Get weather",
    "input_schema": zodSchema.toJsonSchema() // Just different field name
  }

  Google Function Calling:
  // Similar JSON Schema format
  {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Get weather",
    "parameters": zodSchema.toJsonSchema()
  }

  The main differences are just field names (parameters vs input_schema) and minor schema
   dialect variations.

  There are libraries like zod-to-json-schema that handle the Zod→JSON Schema conversion.
   Should we use an existing library or implement our own conversion to ensure we handle
  provider-specific quirks correctly?

> let's handle that when we implement it. is there anything else we still need to
  discuss?

⏺ I think we've covered all the major architectural decisions! Let me do a quick check:

  ✅ Core architecture - ChatClient interface, Context class, provider-specific clients✅
   Conversation flow - structured return types, explicit tool execution✅ Tool
  definitions - Zod schemas, MCP spec compliance✅ Model management - code generation
  from ruby_llm models.json✅ Configuration - provider-specific configs, type-safe model
  factory✅ Error handling - return type based, no callbacks✅ CLI support -
  createClientForModel with derived config types

  The specification looks complete for handing off to a developer. They have clear
  guidance on:
  - API surface design
  - Type safety requirements
  - Tool integration patterns
  - Code generation approach
  - Provider abstraction strategy

  Ready to start building lemmy!

> ah one more thing. i think we should implement streaming in all clients. for UI
  purposes we may want to add an optional callback that receives the current streaming
  result. makes sense?

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants to add streaming support to all clients. This makes sense for AI
  applications where you want to show progressive responses. They're suggesting an
  optional callback for streaming results, which is different from the structured return
  type approach we discussed for tool execution.

  For streaming, a callback actually makes sense because:
  1. It's about real-time data flow, not control flow
  2. You need to handle incremental chunks as they arrive
  3. The alternative would be async iterators, but callbacks are simpler for UI updates

  Let me think about how this would work with the existing API design.

⏺ Absolutely! Streaming is essential for good UX in AI apps, and callbacks make perfect
  sense here since it's about real-time data flow rather than control flow.

  Should the streaming API be a separate method or an option on the existing ask()
  method?

  // Option 1: Separate method
  const response = await claude.stream("Hello", {
    context,
    onChunk: (chunk) => updateUI(chunk.content)
  });

  // Option 2: Option on ask()
  const response = await claude.ask("Hello", {
    context,
    streaming: true,
    onChunk: (chunk) => updateUI(chunk.content)
  });

  // Option 3: Both - ask() for simple, stream() for explicit

  And should the callback receive just the text chunk, or a richer chunk object with
  metadata (like token count, finish reason, etc.)?

  onChunk: (chunk: { content: string, tokens?: number, done: boolean }) => void

> streaming internally is never an option, so does not need to be configurable. the
  callback can be as simple as possible i think. done is signaled via return from ask
  anyways.

✻ Thinking…

  The user is saying that streaming should always be used internally by the clients -
  there's no need for a "streaming: true/false" option. It's just an implementation
  detail that should always be used for performance.

  The callback is just for UI updates during the streaming process, so it can be very
  simple - just the content string. The "done" state is already handled by the ask()
  method returning the final response.

  So the API would be:

  const response = await claude.ask("Hello", {
    context,
    onChunk?: (content: string) => void  // Optional callback for streaming chunks
  });

  This is clean - streaming happens under the hood always, but users can optionally get
  real-time updates via the callback.

⏺ Perfect! So streaming is always used internally for performance, and the callback is
  just for real-time UI updates.

  const response = await claude.ask("Hello", {
    context,
    onChunk?: (content: string) => void  // Optional, just for UI updates
  });
  // ask() still returns the complete final response

  This keeps it simple - users get the benefits of streaming performance without
  complexity, and can optionally hook into the stream for progressive UI updates.

  That covers everything! The lemmy specification is complete and ready for
  implementation.

> we aren't quite done yet. we need to discuss what test framework to use, and how to
  setup the build for packaging. i want the simplest possible test framework with good
  support in VS Code.

⏺ For the simplest testing with good VS Code support:

  Vitest is probably your best bet:
  - Drop-in Jest replacement but faster
  - Excellent VS Code extension with inline test running
  - TypeScript support out of the box
  - Minimal config needed

  // weather.test.ts
  import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';

  describe('weather tool', () => {
    it('should fetch weather data', async () => {
      const result = await weatherTool.execute({ location: 'NYC' });
      expect(result).toBeDefined();
    });
  });

  For packaging, what's your preference - ESM-only, dual packages (ESM + CommonJS), or
  just CommonJS? And should we use a build tool like tsup/rollup or just tsc?

  Most modern packages are going ESM-only now, but some tooling still expects CommonJS.

> i think i want dual packaging? how much more complex is it compared to esm-only?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking about dual packaging (ESM + CommonJS) vs ESM-only, and how much more
   complex it is. Let me think about this:

  ESM-only:
  - Simple build process (just tsc or a single build tool output)
  - Single package.json exports entry
  - Modern approach, but some tools still need CommonJS

  Dual packaging:
  - Need to build two formats
  - More complex package.json with conditional exports
  - Need to handle different import/export patterns
  - More testing (need to test both formats work)
  - Tools like tsup can automate this though

  The complexity difference isn't huge with modern tools, but it's definitely more
  complex than ESM-only. I should give them a realistic assessment.

⏺ Dual packaging is moderately more complex but tools like tsup make it pretty
  manageable:

  ESM-only (simple):
  // package.json
  {
    "type": "module",
    "exports": "./dist/index.js"
  }

  Dual packaging (more complex):
  // package.json
  {
    "type": "module",
    "exports": {
      ".": {
        "import": "./dist/index.js",
        "require": "./dist/index.cjs"
      }
    }
  }

  // tsup.config.ts
  export default {
    entry: ['src/index.ts'],
    format: ['esm', 'cjs'],
    dts: true, // Generate .d.ts files
    clean: true
  }

  Main complexity:
  - Need to test both formats work
  - Conditional exports config
  - Slightly larger bundle size

  Given that many CLI tools and older Node projects still expect CommonJS, dual packaging
   might be worth it for a library like lemmy. Or we could start ESM-only and add
  CommonJS later if needed?

> let's go with dual packaging. another related thing: i may also want to have an
  examples/ folder with example projects using lemmy. how would we go about setting these
   up so they themselves can be packaged if need be, while simultaniously making
  development easy. i.e. i just want to open the lemmy folder in vs code and not have to
  invoke any commands to wire up the core lemmy sources with the example project. it
  should just work ideally. previously, i had to do some npm dance so a project depending
   on lemmy in the same root folder would not fetch it fro node_modules, but directly
  from source (or the build dir). my memory is fuzzy

⏺ You want npm workspaces or pnpm workspaces! This lets you have multiple packages in one
   repo with automatic linking.

  Setup:
  // Root package.json
  {
    "name": "lemmy-monorepo",
    "workspaces": [
      "packages/lemmy",
      "examples/*"
    ]
  }

  Structure:
  lemmy/
  ├── package.json (workspace root)
  ├── packages/
  │   └── lemmy/
  │       ├── package.json
  │       └── src/
  └── examples/
      ├── cli-chat/
      │   ├── package.json
      │   └── src/
      └── web-agent/
          ├── package.json
          └── src/

  Example package.json:
  // examples/cli-chat/package.json
  {
    "name": "lemmy-cli-example",
    "dependencies": {
      "lemmy": "workspace:*"  // Links to local lemmy package
    }
  }

  One npm install at root automatically links everything. VS Code sees it all as one
  project, TypeScript resolves imports correctly, and examples always use your local
  lemmy source.

  Does this match what you remember wanting?

> that sounds perfect. when i release lemmy to npm, will the examples also be released?
  might not want that

⏺ No, with workspaces only the packages you explicitly publish get released to npm.

  The examples won't be published unless you run npm publish in each example directory.
  When you run npm publish from packages/lemmy/, only that package gets published.

  To be extra safe, you can add to each example's package.json:
  // examples/cli-chat/package.json
  {
    "name": "lemmy-cli-example",
    "private": true,  // Prevents accidental publishing
    "dependencies": {
      "lemmy": "workspace:*"
    }
  }

  And in the main lemmy package.json, you can exclude examples from the published
  package:
  // packages/lemmy/package.json
  {
    "files": [
      "dist",
      "README.md"
    ]
    // examples/ not included, so won't be bundled even if somehow published
  }

  This way examples stay local to your repo but never accidentally get published to npm.

> if i want to publish an example to npm, how does the lemmy dependency work? it has to
  pull in a specific version, no?

⏺ Exactly! When publishing an example, you'd need to replace the workspace dependency
  with a real npm version.

  You have a few options:

  Option 1: Manual replacement before publishing
  // During development
  "dependencies": {
    "lemmy": "workspace:*"
  }

  // When publishing example
  "dependencies": {
    "lemmy": "^1.2.3"
  }

  Option 2: Use workspace:^ syntax (if using pnpm)
  // This gets automatically converted on publish
  "dependencies": {
    "lemmy": "workspace:^"  // Becomes "^1.2.3" when published
  }

  Option 3: Build script that updates dependencies
  # Script that updates package.json before publishing example
  jq '.dependencies.lemmy = "^1.2.3"' package.json > package.json.tmp && mv
  package.json.tmp package.json

  The workspace dependency only works within the monorepo - published packages need real
  semver ranges. Most people go with option 1 (manual update) since examples are
  published less frequently.

> alright that makes sense. so i guess we have our scaffolding discussed as well, right?
  anything else we need to discuss?

⏺ I think we've covered everything! Let me do a final check:

  ✅ Core architecture - ChatClient interface, Context class, provider implementations✅
  API design - structured return types, explicit tool execution, streaming with
  callbacks✅ Tool system - Zod schemas, MCP spec compliance✅ Model management - code

       1  # Lemmy API Specification
       2
       3  ## Overview
       4
       5  Lemmy is a TypeScript API wrapper for common LLM SDKs (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Ollama) designed to
         make creating agentic workflows extremely simple. Inspired by ruby_llm, lemmy provides a unified interf
         ace while maintaining provider-specific capabilities and full type safety.
       6
       7  ## Core Architecture
       8
       9  ### Provider-Specific Clients with Common Interface
      10
      11  ```typescript
      12  interface ChatClient {
      13    ask(prompt: string, options: AskOptions): Promise<AskResult>;
      14  }
      15
      16  // Provider-specific clients
      17  const claude = lemmy.anthropic({ apiKey: '...' });
      18  const openai = lemmy.openai({ apiKey: '...' });
      19  const google = lemmy.google({ apiKey: '...' });
      20  const ollama = lemmy.ollama({ baseUrl: '...' });
      21  ```
      22
      23  ### Context Management
      24
      25  The `Context` class manages provider-agnostic state:
      26  - Conversation history (message array)
      27  - Available tools (in MCP format)
      28  - MCP server connections
      29
      30  ```typescript
      31  const context = new Context();
      32  context.addTool(weatherTool);
      33  context.addMCPServer("filesystem", { transport: "stdio", command: "mcp-fs" });
      34
      35  // Provider-agnostic conversations
      36  claude.ask("Hello", { context });
      37  openai.ask("Follow up", { context }); // Same context, different provider
      38  ```
      39
      40  ## API Design
      41
      42  ### Ask Method
      43
      44  ```typescript
      45  interface AskOptions {
      46    context?: Context;
      47    model?: string; // Override default model
      48    onChunk?: (content: string) => void; // Streaming callback
      49  }
      50
      51  type AskResult =
      52    | { type: 'success'; response: ChatResponse }
      53    | { type: 'tool_call'; toolCalls: ToolCall[] }
      54    | { type: 'model_error'; error: ModelError }
      55    | { type: 'tool_error'; error: ToolError; toolCall: ToolCall };
      56  ```
      57
      58  ### Tool Execution Flow
      59
      60  ```typescript
      61  const result = await claude.ask("Book flight and check weather", { context });
      62
      63  if (result.type === 'tool_call') {
      64    // Inspect all pending tool calls
      65    console.log(result.toolCalls);
      66
      67    // Execute selectively or in parallel
      68    await context.executeTool(result.toolCalls[0]);
      69    await Promise.all(result.toolCalls.slice(1).map(tc => context.executeTool(tc)));
      70
      71    // Continue conversation with tool results
      72    const finalResult = await claude.ask("continue", { context });
      73  }
      74  ```
      75
      76  ## Tool System
      77
      78  ### Tool Definition with Zod
      79
      80  ```typescript
      81  const weatherTool = defineTool({
      82    name: "get_weather",
      83    description: "Get current weather for a location",
      84    schema: z.object({
      85      location: z.string().describe("City name or zip code"),
      86      units: z.enum(["celsius", "fahrenheit"]).optional()
      87    }),
      88    execute: async (args) => {
      89      // args is automatically typed
      90      return await fetchWeather(args.location, args.units);
      91    }
      92  });
      93
      94  context.addTool(weatherTool);
      95  ```
      96
      97  ### MCP Server Integration
      98
      99  ```typescript
     100  // Explicit registration at context level
     101  context.addMCPServer("filesystem", {
     102    transport: "stdio",
     103    command: "mcp-fs"
     104  });
     105
     106  // MCP tools automatically available alongside native tools
     107  ```
     108
     109  ## Model Management
     110
     111  ### Code Generation from ruby_llm
     112
     113  A script `scripts/update-models.js` generates TypeScript types and runtime data:
     114
     115  ```typescript
     116  // Generated in src/models.ts
     117
     118  // Types
     119  export type AnthropicModels = 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022' | 'claude-3-5-haiku-20241022';
     120  export type OpenAIModels = 'gpt-4o' | 'gpt-4o-mini';
     121  export type GoogleModels = 'gemini-1.5-pro' | 'gemini-1.5-flash';
     122  export type OllamaModels = string; // Dynamic/user-defined
     123
     124  // Runtime data
     125  export const AnthropicModelData = {
     126    'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022': {
     127      contextWindow: 200000,
     128      maxOutputTokens: 8192,
     129      supportsTools: true,
     130      pricing: { inputPerMillion: 3, outputPerMillion: 15 }
     131    }
     132  } as const;
     133
     134  // Model-to-provider mapping
     135  export const ModelToProvider = {
     136    'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022': 'anthropic',
     137    'gpt-4o': 'openai',
     138  } as const;
     139
     140  // Union types
     141  export type AllModels = AnthropicModels | OpenAIModels | GoogleModels | OllamaModels;
     142  ```
     143
     144  ### Type-Safe Model Factory
     145
     146  ```typescript
     147  // Type mapping from provider to config
     148  type ProviderConfigs = {
     149    anthropic: AnthropicConfig;
     150    openai: OpenAIConfig;
     151    google: GoogleConfig;
     152    ollama: OllamaConfig;
     153  };
     154
     155  // Derive config type from model name
     156  type ConfigForModel<T extends AllModels> = ProviderConfigs[ModelToProvider[T]];
     157
     158  // Type-safe factory function
     159  export function createClientForModel<T extends AllModels>(
     160    model: T,
     161    config: ConfigForModel<T>
     162  ): ChatClient {
     163    const provider = ModelToProvider[model];
     164    // Runtime dispatch to appropriate provider
     165  }
     166
     167  // CLI usage
     168  const client = createClientForModel('claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', {
     169    apiKey: '...' // TypeScript knows this needs AnthropicConfig
     170  });
     171  ```
     172
     173  ## Configuration
     174
     175  ### Provider-Specific Configuration
     176
     177  ```typescript
     178  // Each provider has its own config interface
     179  interface AnthropicConfig {
     180    apiKey: string;
     181    baseURL?: string;
     182    // Anthropic-specific options
     183  }
     184
     185  interface OpenAIConfig {
     186    apiKey: string;
     187    organization?: string;
     188    baseURL?: string;
     189    // OpenAI-specific options
     190  }
     191
     192  // Client creation
     193  const claude = lemmy.anthropic({
     194    apiKey: 'sk-...',
     195    baseURL: 'custom-endpoint'
     196  });
     197  ```
     198
     199  ### Model Selection
     200
     201  ```typescript
     202  // Per-call model selection
     203  claude.ask("Hello", {
     204    model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022',
     205    context
     206  });
     207
     208  // Client-level default with override capability
     209  const claude = lemmy.anthropic({
     210    apiKey: '...',
     211    defaultModel: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022'
     212  });
     213  ```
     214
     215  ## Streaming
     216
     217  All clients use streaming internally for performance. Optional callback for real-time UI updates:
     218
     219  ```typescript
     220  const response = await claude.ask("Hello", {
     221    context,
     222    onChunk: (content: string) => updateUI(content) // Optional streaming callback
     223  });
     224  // ask() still returns complete final response
     225  ```
     226
     227  ## Error Handling
     228
     229  ### Structured Return Types
     230
     231  No callbacks - all error handling through explicit return types:
     232
     233  ```typescript
     234  const result = await claude.ask("Hello", { context });
     235
     236  switch (result.type) {
     237    case 'success':
     238      console.log(result.response);
     239      break;
     240    case 'model_error':
     241      // Handle API failures, rate limits, etc.
     242      // Can retry, abort, or escalate
     243      break;
     244    case 'tool_error':
     245      // Tool execution failed
     246      // Can feed error to model or abort
     247      break;
     248    case 'tool_call':
     249      // Model wants to execute tools
     250      // User decides which tools to execute
     251      break;
     252  }
     253  ```
     254
     255  ### Error Categories
     256
     257  - **Model errors**: API failures, rate limits, authentication issues
     258  - **Tool errors**: Tool execution failures, MCP server issues
     259  - **Success**: Normal completion
     260  - **Tool calls**: Model requesting tool execution
     261
     262  ## Project Structure
     263
     264  ### Monorepo with Workspaces

     289
     290  ### Workspace Configuration
     291
     292  ```json
     293  {
     294    "name": "lemmy-monorepo",
     295    "workspaces": [
     296      "packages/lemmy",
     297      "examples/*"
     298    ]
     299  }
     300  ```
     301
     302  Examples use workspace dependencies:

     304  ```json
     305  {
     306    "name": "lemmy-cli-example",
     307    "private": true,
     308    "dependencies": {
     309      "lemmy": "workspace:*"
     310    }
     311  }
     312  ```
     313
     314  ## Build and Testing
     315
     316  ### Dual Package (ESM + CommonJS)
     317
     318  ```typescript
     319  // tsup.config.ts
     320  export default {
     321    entry: ['src/index.ts'],
     322    format: ['esm', 'cjs'],
     323    dts: true,
     324    clean: true
     325  }
     326  ```
     327
     328  ```json
     329  {
     330    "type": "module",
     331    "exports": {
     332      ".": {
     333        "import": "./dist/index.js",
     334        "require": "./dist/index.cjs"
     335      }
     336    }
     337  }
     338  ```
     339
     340  ### Testing with Vitest
     341
     342  ```typescript
     343  // weather.test.ts
     344  import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
     345
     346  describe('weather tool', () => {
     347    it('should fetch weather data', async () => {
     348      const result = await weatherTool.execute({ location: 'NYC' });
     349      expect(result).toBeDefined();
     350    });
     351  });
     352  ```
     353
     354  ## Implementation Requirements
     355
     356  ### Code Generation
     357
     358  1. **Script**: `scripts/update-models.js`
     359     - Fetch fresh data from ruby_llm models.json
     360     - Filter for text input/output models (ignore image-only)
     361     - Extract tool support capability
     362     - Generate TypeScript types and runtime data
     363     - Generate model-to-provider mappings
     364
     365  2. **Generated File**: `src/models.ts`
     366     - Provider-specific model type unions
     367     - Runtime model metadata objects
     368     - Model-to-provider mapping
     369     - Type-safe factory function
     370
     371  ### Provider Implementation
     372
     373  1. **Common Interface**: All providers implement `ChatClient`
     374  2. **Message Translation**: Convert between provider-specific formats and unified message format
     375  3. **Tool Format Conversion**: Convert Zod schemas to provider-specific tool definitions
     376  4. **Streaming**: Always use streaming internally, expose via callback
     377  5. **Error Handling**: Map provider errors to unified error types
     378
     379  ### Tool System
     380
     381  1. **Zod Integration**: Use Zod for schema definition and validation
     382  2. **MCP Compliance**: Generate MCP-compatible tool definitions
     383  3. **Provider Mapping**: Convert to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google formats
     384  4. **Execution Tracking**: Context tracks executed tools and results
     385
     386  ### Context Management
     387
     388  1. **Message History**: Maintain conversation across providers
     389  2. **Tool Registry**: Store available tools and their implementations
     390  3. **MCP Server Connections**: Manage external MCP server processes
     391  4. **Provider Translation**: Convert messages between provider formats
     392
     393  ## API Entry Points
     394
     395  ```typescript
     396  // Main lemmy object
     397  export const lemmy = {
     398    anthropic: (config: AnthropicConfig) => new AnthropicClient(config),
     399    openai: (config: OpenAIConfig) => new OpenAIClient(config),
     400    google: (config: GoogleConfig) => new GoogleClient(config),
     401    ollama: (config: OllamaConfig) => new OllamaClient(config),
     402  };
     403
     404  // Factory function for CLI usage
     405  export { createClientForModel } from './models';
     406
     407  // Core classes
     408  export { Context, defineTool };
     409
     410  // Types
     411  export type { ChatClient, AskResult, AskOptions };
     412  export type { AllModels, AnthropicModels, OpenAIModels, GoogleModels };
     413  ```
     414
     415  ## Development Workflow
     416
     417  1. **Setup**: `npm install` at root automatically links all workspaces
     418  2. **Development**: VS Code sees entire monorepo, TypeScript resolves correctly
     419  3. **Code Generation**: Run `node scripts/update-models.js` to refresh model data
     420  4. **Testing**: `npm test` in packages/lemmy or root
     421  5. **Building**: `npm run build` generates dual ESM/CJS packages
     422  6. **Examples**: Always use local lemmy source via workspace dependencies
     423
     424  This specification provides a complete foundation for implementing lemmy with all architectural decisi
         ons, type safety requirements, and development workflows clearly defined.

> AskOptions.model makes no sense. We instantiate a client for a specific model once with provider (and possibly
  model) specific options.

  One aspect we haven't talked about: keeping track of tokens/cost. Context will keep track of cost, the client
  knows its model, from which we can derrive the per token cost. I also think some providers give input tokens,
  output tokens, and total tokens, where total tokens can be > input tokens + output tokens as it might include
  thinking tokens. messages in context should each keep track of their respective token counts i think.

  One more aspect is that some providers will tag responses with a stop reason like "not enough output tokens",
  in which case we take what we got so far, stuff it into a message in the context, and resubmit to get the
  remainder of the output. i think this should be done automatically by the client implementation and end up as a
   single message in the context. not sure what to do with providers that don't have this "continue" feature?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is making several important points about the specification that I need to address:

  1. AskOptions.model makes no sense: They're right - if we instantiate a client for a specific model, then the
  model is already determined at client creation time, not per ask() call. This is a good catch.
  2. Token/cost tracking: This is an important aspect we didn't fully discuss. They want:
    - Context to keep track of cost
    - Client knows its model, can derive per-token cost from model metadata
    - Some providers give input tokens, output tokens, total tokens (where total > input + output due to thinking
   tokens)
    - Messages in context should track their token counts
  3. Stop reason handling: Some providers will return a stop reason like "not enough output tokens" and we should
   automatically continue to get the remainder, combining it into a single message in the context. For providers
  that don't support this, we need to figure out what to do.

  These are all valid points that need to be incorporated into the specification. Let me think about how to
  address each:

  1. Model selection: Remove model from AskOptions, make it part of client creation only
  2. Token tracking: Add token tracking to messages and context, with cost calculation
  3. Continuation: Add automatic continuation for providers that support it

  I should acknowledge these points and ask how they want me to proceed with updating the specification.

⏺ You're absolutely right on all points! Let me address these important gaps:

  1. Model selection: You're correct - if we instantiate a client for a specific model, AskOptions.model doesn't
  make sense. The model should be determined at client creation.
  2. Token/cost tracking: Great point! We need:
    - Context tracks total cost across all messages
    - Each message stores its token counts (input/output/total)
    - Client can calculate cost using model pricing data
    - Handle providers that report thinking tokens separately
  3. Automatic continuation: For providers that return "max tokens reached", we should automatically continue and
   merge into a single context message. For providers without this feature, we'd need a fallback strategy.

  Should I update the specification to include:

  - Remove model from AskOptions
  - Add token tracking to message and context interfaces
  - Add automatic continuation logic for incomplete responses
  - Define fallback behavior for providers without continuation support

  For the continuation fallback - should we just accept truncated responses for providers that can't continue, or
   have some other strategy?

> i think we should take not of the truncated responses, but handle them at a later point. everything else looks
  good. please proceed to write the full docs/spec.md file.

  The user wants me to update the specification with the corrections they mentioned:

  1. Remove model from AskOptions since clients are instantiated for specific models
  2. Add token/cost tracking to messages and context
  3. Add automatic continuation logic for incomplete responses
  4. Note truncated responses for later handling (for providers without continuation)

  They want me to write the complete specification to docs/spec.md incorporating all our discussions and these
  corrections.

  Let me structure this comprehensively, including all the details we discussed throughout our conversation.

     ## Overview
     Lemmy is a TypeScript API wrapper for common LLM SDKs (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Ollama) designed to make
     creating agentic workflows extremely simple. Inspired by ruby_llm, lemmy provides a unified interface while
     maintaining provider-specific capabilities and full type safety.

> console.log(context.getTotalCost()); // Total cost across all providers

  context has no reference to a model which stores the per token cost.

  since we can use the same context with multiple clients (differnt models), i guess it would make sense to also
  track which model a specific message in the context came from.

  please adjust the spec

⏺ You're absolutely right! Context doesn't have model information needed for cost calculation. Since we can use
  the same context with multiple clients/models, we need to track which model generated each message.

     162      return (tokens.input * modelData.pricing.inputPerMillion / 1_000_000) +
     163             (tokens.output * modelData.pricing.outputPerMillion / 1_000_000);
     164    }

     169      // Create message with model info for cost tracking
     170      const message: Message = {
     171        role: 'assistant',
     172        content: response.content,
     173        tokens: response.tokens,
     174        cost: this.calculateCost(response.tokens),
     175        provider: 'anthropic',
     176        model: this.model, // Critical for context cost calculation
     177        timestamp: new Date()
     178      };
     179
     180      // Add to context if provided
     181      options.context?.addMessage(message);
     182    }
     183  }
     184  ```
     185

⏺ Perfect! I've updated the specification to address the cost tracking issue:

  Key changes:

  1. Message tracking: Each message now explicitly tracks the model that generated it (required for cost
  calculation)
  2. Context cost calculation: Context can now calculate total costs by looking up pricing data for each model
  that generated messages:
    - getTotalCost() - aggregates costs across all models/providers
    - getCostByModel() - breakdown by specific model
    - getCostByProvider() - breakdown by provider
  3. Client responsibility: Clients calculate the cost when creating messages and attach the model info, so
  Context has everything needed for accurate cost tracking
  4. Multi-model support: Context can now properly handle conversations that span multiple models/providers and
  track costs correctly

  The flow is now: Client → calculates cost using its model pricing → attaches model info to message → Context →
  aggregates costs using model info from each message.

> interface Message {
    role: 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system' | 'tool_result';
    content: string;
    tokens?: TokenUsage;
    cost?: number;
    provider?: string; // Which provider generated this message
    model?: string; // Which model generated this message (required for cost calculation)
    timestamp: Date;
  }

  we calculate cost on the fly based on token usage across all messages in the context based on each messsages
  model. the model string is used to look up the model in the models.ts registry. if it's not found (e.g. custom
  model, local model, whatever) cost is assumed to be 0.

    // Cost estimation before sending
    estimateCost(prompt: string, client: ChatClient): number;

  we don't need that. and this is also wrong/not needed

  // Clients calculate cost and attach model info to messages
  class AnthropicClient implements ChatClient {
    private calculateCost(tokens: TokenUsage): number {
      const modelData = AnthropicModelData[this.model];
      return (tokens.input * modelData.pricing.inputPerMillion / 1_000_000) +
             (tokens.output * modelData.pricing.outputPerMillion / 1_000_000);
    }

     600  ## API Entry Points
     601

⏺ Perfect! I've updated the specification to fix all the issues you mentioned:

  ✅ Removed cost field from Message interface - no longer stored, calculated on-the-fly✅ Context calculates
  costs dynamically - uses model string to lookup pricing in registry, returns 0 for unknown models✅ Removed
  estimateCost method - not needed✅ Removed client cost calculation - Context handles all cost calculation✅
  Added MCP SDK dependency - uses @modelcontextprotocol/sdk for official MCP client connections✅ Updated MCP
  integration description - shows both stdio and SSE transport examples

  Now the cost tracking works correctly:
  1. Clients attach model and tokens to messages
  2. Context calculates costs on-the-fly by looking up each message's model in the registry
  3. Unknown models (custom/local) automatically get cost = 0
  4. No pre-calculated costs stored anywhere - always fresh calculation

  The specification is now accurate and ready for implementation! 🎯

     152      if (!modelData?.pricing) return 0;

⏺ Perfect! Now all the essential fields are required:
  - tokens: TokenUsage - always present for cost calculation
  - provider: string - always present to track which provider generated the message
  - model: string - always present to look up pricing in the model registry

  This ensures consistent cost tracking and makes the implementation more robust since these fields are
  guaranteed to be available.

     617  export { createClientForModel } from './models';
     617  export { createClientForModel } from './factory';
     618
     619  // Core classes
     620  export { Context, defineTool };

⏺ Perfect! Now the type-safe model factory is properly separated:

  ✅ Separate implementation file: src/factory.ts contains the factory function✅ Generated code stays clean:
  src/models.ts only contains generated types and data✅ Better separation of concerns: Generated code vs.
  implementation logic✅ Updated project structure: Shows factory.ts in the file structure✅ Updated exports:
  Factory is exported from ./factory not ./models

  This makes the architecture cleaner - the code generator only needs to produce types and data, while the
  complex factory logic with conditional types lives in a separate, hand-written file that imports from the
  generated models.

> stuff in factory could actually go into index.ts

⏺ You're absolutely right! The factory function would be perfect in index.ts since it's part of the main API
  surface. Let me update the spec:

     289  ### Type-Safe Model Factory for CLI Usage
     290
     291  Implemented in a separate file `src/factory.ts` using the generated model registry:
     291  Implemented in `src/index.ts` alongside the main lemmy API:
     292
     293  ```typescript
     294  // src/factory.ts
     295  import { ModelToProvider, type AllModels } from './models';
     296  import { lemmy } from './index';
     297  import type { AnthropicConfig, OpenAIConfig, GoogleConfig, OllamaConfig } from './types';
     298
     299  // Type mapping from provider to config
     300  type ProviderConfigs = {
     301    anthropic: AnthropicConfig;
     302    openai: OpenAIConfig;
     303    google: GoogleConfig;
     304    ollama: OllamaConfig;
     305  };
     306
     307  // Derive config type from model name
     308  type ConfigForModel<T extends AllModels> = ProviderConfigs[ModelToProvider[T]];
     309
     310  // Type-safe factory function
     311  export function createClientForModel<T extends AllModels>(
     312    model: T,
     313    config: ConfigForModel<T>
     314  ): ChatClient {
     315    const provider = ModelToProvider[model];
     316
     317    switch (provider) {
     318      case 'anthropic':
     319        return lemmy.anthropic({ ...config, model } as AnthropicConfig);
     320      case 'openai':
     321        return lemmy.openai({ ...config, model } as OpenAIConfig);
     322      case 'google':
     323        return lemmy.google({ ...config, model } as GoogleConfig);
     324      case 'ollama':
     325        return lemmy.ollama({ ...config, model } as OllamaConfig);
     326      default:
     327        throw new Error(`Unknown provider for model: ${model}`);
     328    }
     329  }
     330
     294  // CLI usage
     295  const client = createClientForModel('claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', {
     296    apiKey: '...' // TypeScript knows this needs AnthropicConfig

     567  ## API Entry Points
     568
     569  ```typescript
     570  // src/index.ts
     571  import { ModelToProvider, type AllModels } from './models';
     572  import type { AnthropicConfig, OpenAIConfig, GoogleConfig, OllamaConfig } from './types';
     573

     576    anthropic: (config: AnthropicConfig) => new AnthropicClient(config),
     ...
     575    ollama: (config: OllamaConfig) => new OllamaClient(config),
     576  };
     577
     578  // Factory function for CLI usage
     579  export { createClientForModel } from './factory';
     578  // Type mapping from provider to config
     579  type ProviderConfigs = {
     580    anthropic: AnthropicConfig;
     581    openai: OpenAIConfig;
     582    google: GoogleConfig;
     583    ollama: OllamaConfig;
     584  };
     585
     586  // Derive config type from model name
     587  type ConfigForModel<T extends AllModels> = ProviderConfigs[ModelToProvider[T]];
     588
     589  // Type-safe factory function for CLI usage
     590  export function createClientForModel<T extends AllModels>(
     591    model: T,
     592    config: ConfigForModel<T>
     593  ): ChatClient {
     594    const provider = ModelToProvider[model];
     595
     596    switch (provider) {
     597      case 'anthropic':
     598        return lemmy.anthropic({ ...config, model } as AnthropicConfig);
     599      case 'openai':
     600        return lemmy.openai({ ...config, model } as OpenAIConfig);
     601      case 'google':
     602        return lemmy.google({ ...config, model } as GoogleConfig);
     603      case 'ollama':
     604        return lemmy.ollama({ ...config, model } as OllamaConfig);
     605      default:
     606        throw new Error(`Unknown provider for model: ${model}`);
     607    }
     608  }
     609
     610  // Core classes
     611  export { Context, defineTool };
     612

⏺ Perfect! Much cleaner approach:

  ✅ Everything in index.ts - Main lemmy object and factory function together✅ Simpler project structure - No
  separate factory file needed✅ Logical grouping - All API entry points in one place✅ Clean imports - Factory
  imports from generated models and uses main lemmy object

  This makes more sense since the factory function is part of the main API surface and keeps the codebase simpler
   with fewer files. The generated models.ts stays clean with just types and data, while index.ts contains all
  the implementation logic and exports.

> where do test sources go?

⏺ Looking at the project structure I specified, I didn't include test sources! Let me add that to the spec:

     447  │   ├── cli-chat/

⏺ Added a comprehensive test/ directory structure that mirrors the src/ organization:

  ✅ Separate test directory - packages/lemmy/test/ for all test files✅ Mirrors source structure -
  test/clients/, test/tools/ match src/ organization✅ Individual client tests - Each provider gets its own test
  file✅ Component tests - Context, tools, and factory function tests✅ Integration tests - End-to-end testing
  across providers

  This follows common TypeScript project patterns where tests are in a separate directory but mirror the source
  structure for easy navigation.

  ⎿  Interrupted by user

> wait that's wrong we need factory.test.ts. last question is how to execute tests. i guess vs code will pick
  them up. but on CI?

⏺ You're right - we do need factory.test.ts for testing the type-safe model factory! And for CI execution, we'd
  typically add npm scripts. Let me add that to the spec:

     512  ### Testing with Vitest
     513
     514  ```typescript
     515  // weather.test.ts
     515  // test/tools/weather.test.ts
     516  import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
     517
     518  describe('weather tool', () => {
     ...
     532  });
     533  ```
     534
     535  **Test Execution:**
     536  - **VS Code**: Vitest extension automatically discovers and runs tests with inline results
     537  - **CLI/CI**: npm scripts for test execution
     538
     539  ```json
     540  // packages/lemmy/package.json
     541  {
     542    "scripts": {
     543      "test": "vitest",
     544      "test:run": "vitest run",
     545      "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage"
     546    }
     547  }
     548  ```
     549
     550  ## Implementation Requirements
     551
     552  ### Code Generation

⏺ Perfect! Now the testing setup is complete:

  ✅ VS Code integration - Vitest extension provides inline test running and results✅ CI/CLI execution - npm
  scripts for different test scenarios:
  - npm test - Watch mode for development
  - npm run test:run - Single run for CI
  - npm run test:coverage - Coverage reports

  ✅ factory.test.ts included - In the test directory structure for testing the type-safe model factory✅ Test
  organization - Tests mirror source structure in separate test/ directory

  This gives developers the best of both worlds - interactive testing in VS Code during development and reliable
  CI execution with coverage reporting.
