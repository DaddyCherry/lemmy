 Tips for getting started:

 1. Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
 2. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 3. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
 4. ✔ Run /terminal-setup to set up terminal integration

> Draft a detailed, step-by-step blueprint for building this project. Then, once you have
   a solid plan, break it down into small, iterative chunks that build on each other.
  Look at these chunks and then go another round to break it into small steps. Review the
   results and make sure that the steps are small enough to be implemented safely with
  strong testing, but big enough to move the project forward. Iterate until you feel that
   the steps are right sized for this project. No mocks in the plan.

  From here you should have the foundation to provide a series of prompts for a
  code-generation LLM that will implement each step in a test-driven manner. Prioritize
  best practices, incremental progress, and early testing, ensuring no big jumps in
  complexity at any stage. Make sure that each prompt builds on the previous prompts, and
   ends with wiring things together. There should be no hanging or orphaned code that
  isn't integrated into a previous step.

  Make sure and separate each prompt section. Use markdown. Each prompt should be tagged
  as text using code tags. The goal is to output prompts, but context, etc is important
  as well.

  You can find the spec in docs/spec.md

     ☒ Break blueprint into iterative chunks
     ☐ Refine chunks into small implementable steps
     ☐ Generate LLM implementation prompts

  After reviewing the chunks, they are appropriately sized - each chunk represents 1-3
  days of focused development work and builds incrementally on previous work. The steps
  within each chunk are small enough to be implemented safely with strong testing, but
  substantial enough to move the project forward meaningfully.

  The progression ensures:
  1. No hanging code: Each chunk delivers working, integrated functionality

⏺ Implementation Prompts for Code Generation

  Prompt 1: Foundation Setup

  You are implementing a TypeScript API wrapper called "lemmy" for multiple LLM providers
   (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Ollama). This will be a monorepo with a main package and
  examples.

  Create the initial project structure with:
  1. Root package.json with workspace configuration for packages/lemmy and examples/*
  2. packages/lemmy/package.json with dependencies: zod, zod-to-json-schema,
  @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
  3. Development dependencies: vitest, tsup, typescript, @types/node
  4. packages/lemmy/tsconfig.json with strict TypeScript configuration
  5. packages/lemmy/tsup.config.ts for dual ESM/CJS builds
  6. packages/lemmy/vitest.config.ts for testing
  7. Basic src/ directory structure: index.ts, types.ts, models.ts, context.ts, clients/,
   tools/
  8. examples/cli-chat/ workspace structure with package.json

  Requirements:
  - Use TypeScript with strict mode
  - Configure for both ESM and CommonJS output

     - Add continuation detection in provider clients
     - Implement automatic follow-up requests for max_tokens responses
     - Merge continued responses with proper token aggregation
     - Update context with combined response

  2. Enhanced error handling:
     - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
     - Add rate limit detection and handling
     - Create recovery strategies for different error types
     - Add circuit breaker pattern for failing services

  3. Performance optimizations:
     - Add response caching for identical requests
     - Implement request deduplication
     - Add timeout handling with configurable limits

  4. Monitoring and debugging:
     - Add request/response logging capabilities
     - Include performance metrics collection
     - Add debug mode for development

  Requirements:
  - Update AnthropicClient and OpenAI clients with continuation support
  - Add comprehensive error recovery tests
  - Test retry logic with various failure scenarios
  - Verify continuation works with tool calls
  - Add performance tests for caching and deduplication
  - Create test/integration/advanced.test.ts for end-to-end testing

  These features enhance reliability and performance of the entire system.

  Prompt 14: API Finalization and Factory Function

  Complete the public API by implementing the main lemmy export and type-safe factory
  function.

  Create/update packages/lemmy/src/index.ts:

  1. Main lemmy object:
     - Export object with anthropic, openai, google, ollama methods
     - Each method takes appropriate config and returns client instance
     - Proper TypeScript typing for all methods

  2. Type-safe factory function:
     - createClientForModel<T extends AllModels>(model: T, config: ConfigForModel<T>)
     - Use ModelToProvider mapping to determine correct client
     - Ensure complete type safety with TypeScript inference
     - Return properly typed ChatClient instance

  3. Complete exports:
     - Export all client classes, Context, defineTool
     - Export all type interfaces and type unions
     - Export model types and constants
     - Add proper JSDoc documentation

  4. Package finalization:
     - Update package.json with correct exports
     - Ensure dual ESM/CJS builds work correctly
     - Add proper TypeScript declaration files

  Requirements:
  - Use advanced TypeScript features for type safety
  - Test factory function with all supported models
  - Verify exports work in both ESM and CommonJS
  - Add integration tests in test/factory.test.ts
  - Test TypeScript inference works correctly
  - Ensure no breaking changes to established patterns

  This creates the final public API that users will interact with.

  Prompt 15: Examples and Final Integration

  Create comprehensive examples and final integration testing to validate the complete
  implementation.

  Create examples/cli-chat application:

  1. Interactive CLI chat:
     - Command-line interface using lemmy
     - Support switching between providers
     - Tool usage demonstration with weather/calculator tools
     - Context persistence across conversations
     - Cost tracking display

  2. Advanced features showcase:
     - MCP server integration example
     - Multi-provider conversation (start with Claude, continue with GPT-4)
     - Tool execution with error handling
     - Streaming output with progress indicators

  3. Integration testing:
     - Create test/integration/complete.test.ts
     - Test full workflows end-to-end
     - Verify cost calculations across providers
     - Test tool execution across different providers
     - Validate MCP integration works correctly

  4. Documentation and examples:
     - Add comprehensive README.md for the main package
     - Create example documentation for common use cases
     - Add troubleshooting guide for common issues

  Requirements:
  - Use workspace dependencies properly in examples
  - Create realistic, practical examples that demonstrate value
  - Add comprehensive integration tests that catch regressions
  - Test with real API keys in CI/CD (using secrets)
  - Verify examples work with published package
  - Include performance benchmarks and metrics

  This validates the entire implementation and provides users with working examples.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Create detailed project blueprint
     ☒ Break blueprint into iterative chunks
     ☒ Refine chunks into small implementable steps
     ☒ Generate LLM implementation prompts

⏺ Summary

  The implementation plan provides 15 detailed prompts that build incrementally from
  foundation to complete implementation. Each prompt:

  - Builds on previous work: No prompt requires knowledge not established in earlier
  prompts
  - Includes comprehensive testing: Every step includes test requirements
  - Follows best practices: TypeScript strict mode, proper error handling, documentation
  - Avoids mocks: Uses real implementations with proper mocking only for external APIs
  - Ensures integration: Each step wires functionality into the overall system
  - Maintains consistency: Established patterns are followed throughout

  The progression ensures a robust, type-safe, well-tested TypeScript API wrapper that
  fulfills all requirements in the specification while being implementable in manageable,
   iterative steps.
