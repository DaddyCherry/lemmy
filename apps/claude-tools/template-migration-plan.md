# Claude Tools Frontend Migration Plan

## Context & Background

### What We're Migrating

The Claude traffic logger (`apps/claude-tools/`) currently uses a vanilla JavaScript template system that intercepts HTTP requests via mitmproxy, processes conversation flows, and generates interactive HTML reports. The system has grown complex and needs better maintainability.

### Current Architecture

```
apps/claude-tools/
├── claude-logger.py          # mitmproxy-based HTTP interceptor
├── claude-logger.sh          # Shell script wrapper
├── test-traffic.jsonl        # Sample data for testing
├── spec.md                   # Architecture documentation
└── template/                 # Current vanilla JS/CSS system
    ├── index.html            # HTML template with {{PLACEHOLDERS}}
    ├── styles.css            # Terminal-style CSS (600px centered, monospace)
    ├── script.js             # ClaudeViewer class, conversation merging
    └── views.js              # ClaudeViewRenderer class, UI rendering
```

### Key Features to Preserve

1. **Conversation Merging**: Complex algorithm that detects and merges Claude Code's "compact conversations"
2. **SSE Processing**: Extracts thinking blocks and tool calls from Server-Sent Events
3. **Terminal Aesthetic**: Dark theme, monospace fonts, semantic colors, no rounded edges
4. **Model Filtering**: Filter conversations by AI model with real-time count updates
5. **Expandable UI**: Click-to-expand for system prompts, tools, thinking blocks
6. **Self-contained Output**: Single HTML file with all JS/CSS embedded

### Current Data Flow

```
Claude Code → mitmproxy:8080 → claude-logger.py → conversations.jsonl
                                     ↓
claude-traffic.html ← Template injection ← Conversation processing
```

The Python script reads template files, processes raw API pairs into conversations, and injects both data and code into a single standalone HTML file.

### Migration Goals

- **Better DX**: TypeScript, proper build tools, component system
- **Maintainability**: Lit components, proper separation of concerns
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage including Anthropic SDK types
- **Modern Tooling**: Tailwind 4, syntax highlighting, markdown parsing
- **Same Output**: Identical functionality and visual appearance

### Testing Frontend Changes

**Quick Test Command:**

```bash
cd /Users/badlogic/workspaces/lemmy/apps/claude-tools
python3 claude-logger.py test-traffic.jsonl && open claude-traffic.html
```

**Test Data:**

- `test-traffic.jsonl` - Good sample data for testing (lacks thinking blocks)
- Contains 64 API call pairs with conversations, tool calls, model filtering scenarios
- Covers most UI features: navigation, expansion, SSE parsing, conversation merging

**Development Workflow:**

1. Make changes to frontend code
2. Run build: `npm run build` (in frontend directory)
3. Generate HTML: `python3 claude-logger.py test-traffic.jsonl`
4. View results: `open claude-traffic.html`
5. Repeat
